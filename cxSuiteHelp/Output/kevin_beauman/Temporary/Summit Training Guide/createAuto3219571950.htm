        <h2>Create an Automated Case</h2>
        <p><span class="wintitle">Case Management</span> creates a case automatically when a rule is set in a hierarchy supported <span class="wintitle">ForeSee CX Measure</span> to identify a specific survey response, such as an overall <span class="wintitle">Satisfaction</span> score of less than five. </p>
        <p>The process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">A respondent takes a survey for a hierarchy supported <span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> CX Measure</span>.</li>
            <li value="2">Based on the respondent’s answers to certain questions, a rule may be triggered, such as <span class="wintitle">Satisfaction</span> less than five for the overall <span class="wintitle">Satisfaction</span> question.</li>
            <li value="3">A <span class="wintitle">Contact Us Thank You Page</span> displays once the respondent has submitted the survey.</li>
            <li value="4">The respondent fills out their contact information and submits the form.</li>
            <li value="5">A case is then automatically created with the contact information and other data that may provide additional insight.</li>
            <li value="6">An alert notification is sent to the assigned caseworker notifying them of the open case that needs their attention.</li>
            <li value="7">An alert notification is also sent to the respondent letting them know a case has been created on their behalf and someone will be contacting them shortly.</li>
        </ol>
