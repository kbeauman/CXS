            <h2> About Case Management</h2>
        </div>
        <p><span class="wintitle">Case Management</span> issues can be created directly from a survey or be manually entered to manage the lifecycle of a problem resolution or the implementation of improvements. This type of application has several categorizations: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Closed Loop Management</li>
            <li value="2">Find and Fix</li>
            <li value="3">Recovery Management</li>
            <li value="4">Issue Management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A <i>Case</i> is a single repository consisting of the original issue, customer contact information, internal attachments and notes, as well as documentation of what actions are taken in response to the issue. A case is expected to be resolved within a specific time frame (e.g., 72 hours) of its creation. Therefore, <span class="wintitle">Case Management</span> functions on a real-time basis in order to present the most current information.</p>
        <h3>User Roles</h3>
        <p>There are two main user levels for Case Management: </p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="wintitle">Caseworker</span> - This user level sees only cases assigned to them. Caseworkers can add, work, escalate, and resolve a case within their assigned hierarchy level, i.e., they cannot access a case assigned to another caseworker. See <a href="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/CaseMgmt/workCase.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Work on a Case</a> for additional information.</li>
            <li value="2"><span class="wintitle">Manager</span> - This user level sees their assigned hierarchy level, such as a district or region. Managers can perform all the same tasks as a caseworker, but have access to all cases under their supervision. See <a href="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/CaseMgmt/ManageSection.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Managing Cases</a> for additional information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Supporte"></a>Supported Measures</h3>
        <p><span class="wintitle">Case Management</span> creates a case automatically when a rule is set in a hierarchy supported <span class="wintitle">ForeSee CX Measure</span> to identify a specific survey response, such as an overall <span class="wintitle">Satisfaction</span> score of less than five. Manual cases are not created from a survey, but must still be associated with a hierarchy supported <span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> CX Measure</span> in order to be reported in <span class="wintitle">CX Suite</span>.</p>
        <p>Currently, the following <span class="wintitle">CX Measures</span> are capable of integrating with <span class="wintitle">Case Management</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Location/Store</li>
            <li value="2">In Store Pick Up/BOPIS</li>
            <li value="3">Contact Center (No IVR)</li>
            <li value="4">Fulfillment</li>
        </ul>
