You can access the <span class="wintitle">Measure Dashboard</span> by clicking on the desired measure on the <a href="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/cxSuite/cx360.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">CX 360 Dashboard</a>, or by clicking <span class="uicontrol">Surveys</span> in the <a href="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/cxSuite/using.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Top Navigation Bar</a> and selecting the measure from the menu. You can also <a href="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/cxSuite/using.htm#Filterin" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Filter Data</a> and download a <span class="wintitle">PowerPoint</span> slideshow of the displayed data with each card in a separate slide.</p>
        <p>The dashboard is comprised of the following tabs:</p>
        <h2><a name="Analyze"></a>Analyze Survey</h2>
        <p>This tab displays customized widgets, or cards, which are designed to identify areas of success and concern. Click the <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span> icon (<img src="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/Resources/Images/SettingsIcon.png" title="Settings Icon" alt="settings icon" />) of each card to control how data is presented. The following cards are presented:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="wintitle">Gauge</span> - The inside part of the graphic represents the selected measure score, which is also displayed below the graphic. The outside represents the selected benchmark score. The number above the score is a delta representing a comparison to the score for the previous date range. For example: if your date range is set to <span class="option">Last Quarter</span>, this number represents how your last quarter score compares to the previous quarter. You can click on the number to toggle between a numeric and percentage display.</li>
            <li value="2"><span class="wintitle">Trend</span> - A bar chart of the measure score for each year with the selected benchmark and <span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Top Performers</span>.</li>
            <li value="3"><span class="wintitle">Score Summary</span> - A color coded bar chart of each measure score and impacts. Click a score to display details.</li>
            <li value="4"><span class="wintitle">Trended Priority Map</span> - A graphical representation of each measure in four quadrants based on <span class="wintitle">Score</span> and <span class="wintitle">Impact on Satisfaction</span>. <span class="wintitle">Impacts</span> are graphed on the x-axis and measure scores are graphed on the y-axis. The purpose of this card is to illustrate where improvements need to be made (displayed in the lower quadrants) and which area is most likely to give the highest return on investment (displayed in the right quadrants). The size of the circle is proportioned to the <span class="wintitle">Impact</span> and top priority elements reside in the lower right quadrant.</li>
            <li value="5"><span class="wintitle">Comments</span> - A list of open end responses with the date of submission and the Satisfaction score given by the respondent.</li>

            <li value="1"><span class="wintitle">#</span> - A reference number indicating where the respondent falls in respect to the <span class="wintitle">Default View</span> sort order. For example, if the <span class="wintitle">Default View</span> is sorted by descending order of the <span class="wintitle">Date</span>, #1 is the most recent response and #37 has that many responses submitted more recently. </li>
            <li value="2"><span class="wintitle">Date</span> - A timestamp of when the survey was submitted. The data is sorted by this column to show the most recent response.</li>
