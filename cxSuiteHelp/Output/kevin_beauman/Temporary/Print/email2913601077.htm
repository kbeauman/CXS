        <h1>Email Deployment</h1>
        <p>This is a method of survey deployment that allows an invitation to be emailed to a target audience with a link to ForeSee hosted, web-based survey.</p>
        <h2><a name="HOW"></a>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Email invitation is sent to target audience.</li>
            <li value="2">Either ForeSee or a Client can send the email invitation.</li>
            <li value="3">Client will identify eligible email addresses - ForeSee does <b>NOT</b> offer list management or sample management services.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="WHAT2"></a>What Touchpoint Measures Use It?</h2>
        <p>Here are a few touchpoints where this deployment may be common:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Contact Center</li>
            <li value="2">Fulfillment</li>
            <li value="3">Loyalty Program</li>
            <li value="4">Employee Satisfaction</li>
            <li value="5">Customer Relationship Measure</li>
            <li value="6">Digital Contribution</li>
            <li value="7">Mobile OnExit (e.g., acct management, self service, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="FORESEE2"></a>ForeSee Sends Email Invite: Email Customization</h2>
        <p>The following items within the email invitation can be configured for a specific client:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Logo</li>
            <li value="2">From Line – there are three options:<ul><li value="1">Default – (display) ForeSee Results Email Notifier (address) [<u>mailto: email_notifier@foreseeresults.com</u>]</li><li value="2">Alias – (display) Customer can define. For example ABC Company Customer Service (address) [<u>mailto: email_notifier@foreseeresults.com</u>]</li><li value="3">Their own - (display) Customer can define.  For example ABC Company Customer Service (address) [<u>mailto: marriott@marriott.com</u>]</li></ul></li>
            <li value="3">To – this will go to the email addresses provided</li>
            <li value="4">Subject Line</li>
            <li value="5">Greeting – there are two options:<ul><li value="1">Generic – for example ‘Dear valued customer’</li><li value="2">Personalized – Dear Mary Smith. Note: the name would need to be provided in the email file. If a name is not available for every record, then a generic greeting would also be needed.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="6">Email Content</li>
            <li value="7">Signature Line</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following items within the reminder emails are also configurable:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Subject Line</li>
            <li value="2">Email Content</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2><a name="FORESEE"></a>ForeSee Sends Email Invite: Fielding Guidelines</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Time between email collection and invitation delivery is configurable:<ul><li value="1">Purchase - Typically, email invitation goes out immediately.</li><li value="2">Digital Contribution - Typically, email invitation goes out seven days after the visit (depends on the length of the shopping funnel - i.e., we want to allow the respondent enough time to conduct follow-up activities. Car Shopping = longer funnel, Electronics = shorter funnel).</li><li value="3">All Other Measures = Timeline to be discussed during implementation. Dependent on who is sending and how frequently client can accommodate. Ideally, we would send the invitation as close to the interaction being evaluated as possible.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="2">Number of reminder emails<ul><li value="1">Number of reminders is typically two, sent at three and seven days after the original invitation.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="3">The standard survey expiration time frame is seven days after the final reminder is sent out.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="FORESEE6"></a>ForeSee Sends Email Invite: ForeSee Capabilities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Deduping:</b> ForeSee can accommodate deduplicating the email list against other email lists that the client has sent previously and merging lists to a single email list. Also to manage repeat days process (e.g., don’t invite within X number of days).</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Do Not Contact:</b> ForeSee maintains a client-specific list of email recipients that have requested not to be contacted by ForeSee again for this client’s surveys.</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Opt-Out Process:</b> ForeSee is not able to manage an opt-out process for the client or within the client’s CRM system. An opt-out link is typically included at the bottom of the ForeSee sponsored email invitation.</li>
            <li value="4"><b>Survey Link Expiration:</b> See <a href="#FORESEE" title="Click to view this section." alt="Click to view this section.">Fielding Guidelines</a> section.</li>
            <li value="5"><b>Response Activity Tracking:</b> ForeSee captures the following parameters and can create a waterfall report on them if requested.  The report can be set up to run at a frequency of the client’s choice, though weekly is default.
                <ul><li value="1">Number of rows in the email address file</li><li value="2">Number of emails successfully sent out</li><li value="3">Number of emails failed to send</li><li value="4">Number of email invitations opened</li><li value="5">Number of surveys displayed (e.g., the URL within the email was clicked on)</li><li value="6">Number of surveys submitted</li></ul></li>
            <li value="6"><b>Random Selection Within a Single List:</b> We can programmatically select every Nth row in a file to allow for random sampling across that file. We would provide guidance on what the "Nth" should be based on the volume of available emails within a file and the desired N Count.</li>
        </ul>
