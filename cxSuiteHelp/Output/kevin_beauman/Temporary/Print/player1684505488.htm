        <h1><a name="WebBasedPlayer"></a>Web Based Player</h1>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Web Based Player</span> is the primary interface for viewing <span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Replays</span>.</p>
        <p>The player consists of two primary types of controls:</p>
        <ol>
            <li value="1">The basic <span class="wintitle">Session Controls</span> provide the following functions:
				<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/Resources/Images/player1.png" title="Click to view." alt="session controls" class="responsive" /></p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li value="1">Page number and page title -  This line may be expanded to show the full URL. The page number refers to the sequence of pages viewed by the respondent which are listed in the <span class="wintitle">Page Selector</span>. When a page title is not available, the URL is displayed. </li><li value="2"><span class="uicontrol">Delete Recording</span> - Users with administrator permissions may delete a recording, as well as the entire response entry. </li><li value="3"><span class="uicontrol">Full Screen</span>/<span class="uicontrol">Restore</span> - Expand the replay session to full screen. When in <span class="wintitle">Full Screen</span> mode, this control toggles to <span class="uicontrol">Restore</span> to the original size.</li><li value="4"><span class="uicontrol">Download</span> - Export the video file to your hard drive.</li><li value="5">Home page, date, and time-stamp of the session -These features are disabled and do not display in full-screen mode.</li><li style="page-break-before: always;" value="6"><span class="uicontrol">Device Information</span> - <span class="wintitle">Device Information</span> displays key facts about the device type (e.g., Personal Computer, Tablet, or Mobile Phone Handset), the browser (e.g., <span class="wintitle">Safari</span>, <span class="wintitle">Internet Explorer</span>, or <span class="wintitle">Chrome</span>), and the physical orientation of the device (e.g., landscape or portrait) as it changes while the user interacts with the website (if the device is capable of providing this information). The orientation and movement of the device is captured during user interaction, which can be viewed during a session replay.</li><li value="7"><span class="uicontrol">Annotations</span> – A text field to allow reviewers to leave comments for other viewers. The <span class="wintitle">Annotation</span> feature allows you to input comments or observations about a given replay for future reference, and for sharing with other users who review the replays. The input function is a simple note taking feature which allows any free form comments that are relevant. A blue bar displays along the bottom of the <span class="wintitle">Histogram</span> to indicate the annotation. A best practice is for each user to leave their initials, date of the comment, and a reference point in the replay where the comment applies to.<div class="example">FS 05/20/2016 @1:15 User does something...</div></li><li style="page-break-before: always;" value="8"><span class="uicontrol">Heatmaps</span> - The <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> allows you to see the most active areas of the screen across multiple user interactions, providing insight on the ease of use and engaging content display of the page. <span class="wintitle">Click</span>, <span class="wintitle">Page Scroll</span>, and <span class="wintitle">Mouse Movement Heatmaps</span> are available for <span class="wintitle">Personal Computer</span> based interactions. Additionally, you can include <span class="wintitle">URL&#160;Parameters</span> and/or <span class="wintitle">Respondent Filters</span>. <span class="wintitle">Touch</span> and <span class="wintitle">Page Scroll Heatmaps</span> are available for mobile device interactions. See <a href="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/Replay/heatMaps.htm" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">Heat Maps</a> for more information.</li><li value="9"><span class="uicontrol">Page Selector</span> – The ability to move to any page within a given session by selecting a thumbnail. The <span class="uicontrol">Page Selector</span> feature is a control that allows you to see all pages involved in a given replay. This function provides an interactive thumbnail view of each page which allows you to navigate directly to that point in the replay.The page number being viewed displays with the page title along the top of the player.</li></ol></li>
            <li style="page-break-before: always;" value="2">The <span class="wintitle">Session Histogram</span> overlay contains standard media player controls which allow the full motion of the replay to be managed. <![CDATA[			]]><p><img src="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/Resources/Images/player2.png" title="Click to view." alt="session histogram" target="_blank" class="responsive" /></p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li value="1">Time Elapsed and Total viewing time.</li><li value="2"><span class="uicontrol">Page Back</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Back 15</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Play/Pause</span> (toggle), <span class="uicontrol">Forward 15</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">Page Forward</span> - These controls allow you to go to the beginning of the page which the respondent visited prior to the displayed page, jump back 15 seconds, play or pause the replay, jump forward 15 seconds, and go to the beginning of the next page visited.</li><li value="3">Histogram - Red vertical lines indicate inactivity which the player skips over. A blue horizontal line indicates an annotation. Click the <span class="uicontrol">Annotation</span> icon  to display.</li><li value="4"><span class="uicontrol">Replay Speed</span> - Click the gauge to adjust the speed of the replay from actual time (1x) to twenty times the actual speed (20x).</li></ol></li>
