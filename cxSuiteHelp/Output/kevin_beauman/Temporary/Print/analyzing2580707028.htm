        <h1>Analyzing Data</h1>
        <p>When you configure <span class="wintitle">Text Analytics</span> to be applied to certain surveys and questions, the <span class="wintitle">Text Analytics</span> engine queues up the comments for classification. Once the processing is completed the analysis is available in the dashboard for review.</p>
        <div class="note">If you are a new user to <span class="wintitle">Text Analytics</span>, no data is available to review in the dashboard unless you have selected the measure and questions for analysis in the Settings tab. </div>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Text Analytics Dashboard</span> consists of the <span class="wintitle">Keywords</span> and Settings tabs, and offers a filter bar containing the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="wintitle">Measure Menu</span> - Click the displayed measure to open a menu of available measures to select from.</li>
            <li value="2">
                <p><span class="wintitle">Date Picker</span> - Click on the date range in the toolbar to display the <span class="wintitle">Date Picker</span>. The <span class="wintitle">Date Picker</span> offers the following options for limiting data to a specific range of dates:<ul><li value="1">A list of preset date ranges along the left side which you can select to implement. When you click on a range the <span class="wintitle">Date Picker</span> closes and the screen refreshes to display data within the selected dates.</li><li value="2"><span class="wintitle">Start Date</span> and <span class="wintitle">End Date</span> text fields where you can type in the desired dates. When you enter the start and end dates the screen refreshes to display data within those dates.</li><li value="3">A calendar displaying the current and previous month and the current date range highlighted. Click the start and end dates to set the range. Use the single arrows (&lt; and &gt;) to scroll one month at a time. Use the double arrows (&lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;) to scroll one year at a time. When you select the start and end dates the screen refreshes to display data within those dates and the <span class="wintitle">Start Date</span> and <span class="wintitle">End Date</span> fields are updated.</li></ul>            Click outside the <span class="wintitle">Date Picker</span> to close.</p>
            </li>
            <li value="3">
                <p><span class="wintitle">Survey Filter</span> - Click <span class="uicontrol">Add a Filter</span> to display a list of preset filters or switch to your saved filters. These filters allow you to select specific questions and answer options of the current survey, which is displayed to the left of the <span class="wintitle">Date Picker</span>. Each selected filter displays below the secondary bar. You can apply multiple filters as desired and save the combination of filters as a new filter.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below the filter bar, the <span class="wintitle">Sentiment</span> filter allows you to focus on positive, neutral, or negative sentiment comments by clicking the green, gray, and red face icons.</p>
        <p>Data is displayed on the following cards:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="wintitle">Topic Wordcloud</span> - Displays the most commonly used words in size proportion of frequency and color coded according to the overall sentiment of the open ends each word is used. For example, if several respondents are reporting an issue where they clicked on a link and nothing happened, you might see the word "click" appearing in red and in a larger size.<p>This card offers two types of displays, <span class="wintitle">Wordcloud</span> and <span class="wintitle">Treemap</span>, as well as buttons for the number of words to display.</p></li>
            <li value="2"><span class="wintitle">Top Keywords</span> - A bar chart of the top 10 words during the selected time span, showing the amount of positive, neutral, and negative statements in which the word was used. This card typically displays top 10 frequently occurring words/topics, with the exception of a search term that is not in top 10. When a search is applied to show a specific word, this word is included in the chart regardless of its frequency.<p>Hover over each bar to view the breakdown of positive, neutral, and negative occurrences.</p></li>
            <li value="3"><span class="wintitle">Comments</span> - A list of open end responses to the displayed question. This list contains the overall Satisfaction Score given by the respondent, the Sentiment of the comment, the comment itself, and the date which the comment was submitted.<p>The header of the comment column contains a menu of all open end questions and can be used to display results from each of these questions. Click on any of the column headers to sort the comments according to the clicked column. The <span class="wintitle">Comments</span> card also offers ability to view details of the response (all survey scores, device, browser, and other parameters), and Replays associated with a response.</p></li>
