        <h2><a name="Feedback"></a>Feedback Deployment - Web Link
</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Who is responsible for sending the email with a URL, <span class="wintitle">ForeSee</span> or the client?</p>
        <p>The client decides what to do with the URL, whether to put it in an email, on their web site, or in a text message.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can CPPs be added to a web link?</p>
        <p>This feature is currently in development and is tentatively planned to be included in the 2017 Spring Release.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can a JavaScript link still be created?</p>
        <p>Yes, the release of the <span class="wintitle">Web Link</span> feature does not impact the use of a JavaScript.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">How many Feedback deployment options are there?</p>
        <p>You now have three options for deployment: the new <span class="wintitle">Web Link</span>, JavaScript, and popup/badge.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">If I make changes to the survey project, will the Web Link still work?</p>
        <p>Yes, as long as the project is active, the <span class="wintitle">Web Link</span> invokes the current version of the survey regardless of when the link was distributed.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Is Web Link included in the project?</p>
        <p>Yes, the <span class="wintitle">Web Link</span> is available on the <a href="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/Feedback/publishing.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Publishing</a> page for both <span class="wintitle">Staging</span> and <span class="wintitle">Production</span> environments.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Does Web Link require a code package?</p>
        <p><span class="wintitle">ForeSee® Cloud Deployment</span> is required for <span class="wintitle">Web Link</span> and is automatically active.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can the code snippet (on the Publishing page) be added to a stand-alone web page? For example, a Call Center wants to deploy their own Feedback survey using Web Link and launch the survey from their Q&amp;A web page that is not connected to the corporate site.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">As long as the code snippet is correctly added to the header of the page and the respondent is using a supported browser, the survey will show as expected.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can a single <span class="wintitle">Feedback</span> project be deployed with multiple methods, e.g., badge and URL?</p>
        <p>Yes, you can use either method or both. However, only one <span class="wintitle">Web Link</span> is available for each project.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">In the Project Center, is there going to be a visual way to see which projects are using which deployment methods?</p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Currently, no. However, this feature is under consideration for a future release.</p>
        <h3><a name="Survey"></a>Survey</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Is the Star question still required?</p>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <h3><a name="Survey2"></a>Survey Configuration</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Is pixel width being used to determine whether a tablet or desktop device is being used?</p>
        <p>No. ForeSee uses a third-party service with a more sophisticated application to determine the type of device being used.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Is having no text on the badge new?</p>
        <p>Yes, as well as a different shape.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Is the badge color customizable to a hexadecimal value?</p>
        <p>Yes. See <a href="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/Feedback/configureSurvey.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Configuring a Survey</a> for more information.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">The Size controller for the badge is a slider. Is that continuous?</p>
        <p>No. Currently, there are three options: small, medium, and large.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">If you don't show any topics, does the Star question still display?</p>
        <p>Yes, there is no setting for hiding the Star question.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">If you comprehensively white-list all topics, will the Star question still display?</p>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What is the character limit of the text boxes?</p>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Short Text</span> box has a limit of 100 characters. The <span class="wintitle">Comment</span> text box has a limit of 1000 characters.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Adding a topic is now a link at the bottom of the survey?</p>
        <p>Yes, this new location is more of an in-line style for adding topics.</p>
        <h2><a name="New"></a>New Survey Experience</h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">How is the logical grouping of questions determined?</p>
        <p>Element Questions are grouped one per page.  Custom Questions and non-Element Questions are also grouped one per page.  For clients with lots of custom questions we are looking at putting them all on one page.  Even though there may be a lot of questions we have some nice automation which automatically advances the pages as the survey taker answers the questions.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Does ForeSee capture partial completes?</p>
        <p>Only if the respondent completes all Model Questions can a score be calculated.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Are we exposing the partial completes into the portal?</p>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Does ForeSee track drop-off rates, and (if so) on what pages?</p>
        <p>This feature is currently being developed and scheduled for an upcoming release.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Is there a progress bar?</p>
        <p>Yes, at the top of the survey.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Is there a concern that the progress bar may be slow, such as when there are 40 questions per page?</p>
        <p>This is currently being tested by a focus group.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">How does the auto-page advance work?</p>
        <p>When all the questions are completed, the survey advances.  If the respondent wants to skip an optional question, they must click/touch the forward button.  This is like a rolling set of questions and not so much pages.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Currently, ForeSee has a lot of skip-logic grouping. Is that considered a grouping on one page or separate pages?</p>
        <p>Separate pages.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">If Custom Questions (CQs) are required, do they need to be completed in order to get a partial complete?</p>
        <p>No, only the model questions are needed.  CQs, required or not, do not need to be answered for a partial complete.  <span class="wintitle">ForeSee</span> is considering adding a CCP to identify that the response is a partial complete in order to segment that response differently.</p>
        <h2><a name="Roles"></a>Roles and Permissions </h2>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can you edit user roles and permissions?</p>
        <p>This feature is currently in development and is scheduled to be released soon.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">What is the default on permissions?</p>
        <p>Feedback permissions currently do not have a default setting. Permissions are set up by the Delivery Operations Team.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Can you set up specific Feedback access for a role, like certain pages users can deploy on or certain projects?</p>
        <p>Currently, permissions are at the project level. You cannot restrict to deploy only on certain pages of a website.</p>
