        <h1>Heat Maps</h1>
        <p>Usage patterns are represented in a <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> consisting of a colored indication of most intense/frequent (red) through least intense/frequent (blue). This displays as an overlay on the individual session so you can visually analyze individual sessions in context of other sessions. </p>
        <div class="example">Using the <span class="wintitle">Mouse Movement</span> heat map to display color coded areas where movement is prevalent, you notice a visitor moves the mouse back and forth between two features. The <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> indicates that this behavior is common since the area between the two feature is red. You may decide to clarify the differences between the two in order to help visitors make their choice. Conversely, if the <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> does not identify this area as a hot spot, you may conclude that the individual's behavior is unique and decide the features need no additional clarification.</div>
        <h3>More on Heat Maps</h3>
        <p><span class="wintitle">Heatmaps</span> can be generated from the <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> tab of the <a href="file:///C:/Users/kevin.beauman/Documents/CX-Help-and-Training-Guide/cxSuiteHelp/Content/Replay/player.htm" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">Web Based Player</a>. The generation of the <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> is done on demand at the time of the request. As <span class="wintitle">Heatmaps</span> incorporate a specific set of users based on your date range, filter criteria or both it is important to note that generating a <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> can take several seconds to complete. All maps are generated off of actual interactions on each page and do not incorporate time into the mapping. The following types of <span class="wintitle">Heatmaps</span> are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Clicks - This <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> is available for desktop devices to highlight the areas of a page, or pages, where the aggregate respondents have clicked on. The total number of respondents included in a <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> is displayed below the playback speed setting. Each map has a top end limit of 250 maximum respondents that are considered when generating the <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span>. You can also show or hide the page URL during playback.</li>
            <li value="2">Touches - This <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> is available for touch-screen devices only and defines where the aggregate respondents touches each page.</li>
            <li value="3">Page Scroll - This <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> displays what part of a page was in view most frequently for the aggregate respondents. Each portion of the page that is in view during a given session is captured to generate the scroll map indicating the most viewed areas.</li>
            <li value="4">Mouse Movement - This <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> is available for desktop devices to illustrate the mouse movement of the aggregate respondents on a given page. As the mouse travels across the page, the “X” and “Y” (up/down and side to side) is recorded to generate the heaviest travel pattern areas.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Heat Map Options</h3>
        <p>By default, all <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> types are based on all responses for the selected date range and any URL parameters are ignored, or truncated. You can apply URL parameters and any filters you may have in the left pane by selecting the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><span class="wintitle">Include all URL parameters</span> - Use the full URL parameter option to only generate <span class="wintitle">Heatmaps</span> that are of a specific page verses a higher level page or master template page.</li>
            <li value="2"><span class="wintitle">Include respondent filters</span> - Generate a <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> based on <span class="wintitle">Filters</span> listed in the left pane.</li>
        </ul>
