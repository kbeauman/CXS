        <h1>Competitor with Panel (without Panel)</h1>
        <p>Competitor with Panel is a touchpoint that allows clients to obtain a direct comparison of performance metrics (Elements, Satisfaction and Future Behaviors) as well as KPIs (Custom Questions) of a specific experience/channel across three to five brands. This is accomplished by partnering with a panel sample provider to deploy our model-based survey to a targeted group of respondents during a specific timeframe.</p>

        <h2><a name="ACTIONAB"></a>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <p>Telecom provider learned that customers looking for help/support are significantly less satisfied than those visiting for sales or account management related tasks, and that a satisfactory online support experience is a weakness across the competitive set. This led to follow-up Insight and Usability Reviews for telecom provider's continuous support measurement to better understand specific improvement opportunities to propel their online support experience ahead of the competition.</p>
        <p>Telecom provider discovered that one-in-six customers who were required to login during their site visit, had to try more than once to login, an issue not as prevalent among competitors. As a result, telecom provider requested follow-up Insight and Usability Reviews for their continuous account management measurement to uncover specific improvement opportunities for the login process.</p>
        <p>Telecom provider found that three-in-ten current customers are considering switching providers, the highest switch consideration among all providers. Further, customers who have been with the provider more than two years express the greatest consideration for switching, but almost half of would-be switchers are willing to give the provider a chance to retain them. As a result, telecom provider understands the significant need to develop customer loyalty retention strategies.</p>
