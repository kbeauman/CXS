        <h1>Cart/Checkout Abandon</h1>
        <p>Cart/Checkout Abandon measures the satisfaction with the shopping experience among visitors who placed items in the shopping cart but did not enter the checkout process, and visitors who entered the checkout process but did not complete a  purchase.</p>
        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>Retailers lose out on billions of dollars in sales every year due to cart and checkout abandonment.  With retailers already facing very small online conversion rates, it’s imperative to know exactly what issues are leading customers to not finish the purchase process.  Cart/Checkout Abandon gives companies the ability to focus in on those consumers who abandoned the purchase process and determine exactly why they did not complete their purchase, giving them a significant advantage on their competitors.</p>
        <h2><a name="TARGET"></a>Target Audience</h2>
        <p><b>Web/Mobile Content Managers</b> - An issue with the website content, whether it’s images, text, audio, video, or multimedia, can be the cause of serious frustration during a website visit. Enough so that a visitor may just abandon their cart or checkout process.  Content managers need to know if and which website content is hurting the bottom line.</p>
        <p><b>eCommerce Managers</b> - Ultimately, issues with eCommerce falls on the shoulders of these managers.  They are responsible for the eCommerce strategy, along with the planning and approval of the website development and any website maintenance. So the longevity of their employment is contingent on quickly resolving issues that affect the bottom line.</p>
        <p><b>Web Design Team</b> - The web design team may be interested in why visitors are abandoning their cart or checkout process as there may be an issue that was caused by a design component or requires a design viewpoint to remedy.</p>
        <h2><a name="ACTIONAB"></a>Actionable Insights</h2>

        <h2>Complementary Touchpoints</h2>
        <p><b>Web/Mobile - Browse Measure</b> - Providing visitors with all the information they need, when they need it and how they need it is important in finalizing their purchase decision.  It’s not just issues with placing an item in the cart or with the checkout process that causes visitors to abandon before purchase. Any issue that comes up at any point in the visit may be enough to cause them to end their visit. Even if that issue happened prior to them placing the items in their cart or starting the checkout process.</p>
        <p><b>Web/Mobile - Purchase</b> - The ability to compare those that finished the purchase process against those that abandoned somewhere before completion is a useful tool to have as it adds another layer of understanding to the entire website experience.</p>
        <h2><a name="GENERAL"></a>General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">For either Cart Abandon or Checkout Abandon measures, we must be able to identify that something has been added to the basket/cart or that the checkout process has begun.<ul><li value="1">If we need to check if somebody has added something to their basket, it most likely requires the client to provide an identifier for us (JS variable or cookie).</li><li value="2">If we are trying to identify the checkout process, most of the time we will use the URL pattern provided by the client.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Triggering Mechanisms Available:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><u>Trigger Option #1</u>: Present the invitation to the Browse survey. Once we see someone has entered the checkout/basket, or added an item in their cart, our code uses logic to move them from a Browse to the Abandon survey.<ul><li value="1">We cannot use this method if True Conversion is used with the Browse survey due to the fact we have to lock the visitor into the Browse measure since True Conversion is only applicable to Browse measures.</li></ul></li>
            <li value="2"><u>Trigger Option #2</u>: Present the invitation after we see that an item is in the cart, or on the first page of the checkout flow.</li>
            <li value="3"><u>Trigger Option #3</u>: Use a "click event" to launch our tracker window, skipping the invitation. On click of a button, like “add to cart” or “proceed to checkout”, the tracker window is set to launch x% of the time.<ul><li value="1">Some browsers do not allow the tracker window to focus to the background automatically. In this case, the tracker presents on top of the browsing window.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
