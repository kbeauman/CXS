        <h1>Employee Experience Measurement</h1>
        <p>Employee Experience is a measurement of an organization’s employees, at both corporate level or store associate/agent level.</p>
        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>It costs a business about one-fifth of a worker’s salary to replace that worker.  A business can improve their employee engagement and reduce their employee turnover by using ForeSee<sup>®</sup>’s Employee Experience Measurement to provide insights into such areas as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">What experiences matter?</li>
            <li value="2">What does our workforce value?</li>
            <li value="3">What employee initiatives should we plan for next year?</li>
            <li value="4">Is our current thinking on improving employee engagement on track?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="TARGET"></a>Target Audience</h2>
        <h3>Economic Stakeholders Targeting:</h3>
        <h4>Human Resources Leaders (e.g., VP/Director HR)</h4>
        <p>Among the many responsibilities, HR teams must ensure that employee benefits, compensation, training, and work tools are meaningful and contribute to employee engagement in the workplace. The right HR programs can create a rewarding experience within a company and as a result reduce unnecessary turn-over and absenteeism.</p>
        <h4>Business Owners (Small Business Option)</h4>
        <p>For small businesses (less than 250 employees), there may not be anybody in HR who can make the decision to purchase our Employee Experience solution.  In this case, the decision maker is probably the business owner.  For small businesses, the ability to absorb employee issues is greatly reduced due to the decrease in scale, so the business owner needs to be aware of their employee’s engagement.  The owner also has many other job duties, so having somebody to partner with to help understand the pulse of their employees is crucial as it allows the owner to focus on the day to day operations of the company.</p>
        <h2><a name="COMMON"></a>Common CQs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Improvement: In which of the following areas does the company need to improve? (select all that apply)</li>
            <li value="2">Inclusion: Do you feel you are part of a team when you come to work?</li>
            <li value="3">Leadership: Do you feel confident in the direction of the company as provided by our executive leadership?</li>
            <li value="4">Tenure: How long have you been employed with this company?</li>
            <li value="5">Questions about/rating benefits, performance reviews, and/or training.</li>
        </ul>
