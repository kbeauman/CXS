        <h1>Customer Relationship Measurement</h1>
        <p>Customer Relationship Measurement (CRM) is a single, dedicated measurement of the target audience’s satisfaction with the overall relationship with the company cumulative of all interactions.  It is not intended to measure satisfaction with a specific channel, in-channel experience, or brand affinity/awareness.</p>
        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>A CRM measure provides executives and customer-focused leadership roles with a company-level view on their performance with customer relationships. This measure provides a customer view above and beyond any channel interactions or specific experiences.  A CRM measure provides companies with an overall satisfaction score reflecting their relationship with their customer base. This measure paints a broad stroke around how the company is satisfying their customers overall and could provide direction on channel preference and usage pattern - which could help the company strategize around which channels to invest in further from a measurement perspective.</p>
        <h2><a name="TARGET"></a>Target Audience</h2>
        <h3>Customer Experience Leadership</h3>
        <p>Customer experience leadership need to be able to measure the strength of their customer relationships and identify company-level focus areas.</p>
        <h3>Company Executives</h3>
        <p>Executives want a company-level view of their performance with customer relationships, and as such, they need company level KPIs rather than the cross-channel insights that can be found with specific in-channel measurements.  This allows them to align the entire organization behind key drivers of satisfaction.</p>
        <h2><a name="ACTIONAB"></a>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <p>A client’s CRM measure revealed that independent and franchise dealers were dissatisfied with their product experience from the client’s organization. Many dealers felt the service was not generating enough qualified leads for their business and that the online classifieds provider was not creating sufficient ROI. Furthermore, because of these sentiments, the CRM measure revealed that independent and franchise dealers were highly unlikely to purchase services in the future.</p>
        <h2><a name="COMMON"></a>Common CQs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">What is your preferred channel for doing business with company x?</li>
            <li value="2">What percentage of purchases in this category do you make with company x?</li>
            <li value="3">How likely are you to switch to a different provider in this category?</li>
            <li value="4">Also includes questions on demographics, psychographics, number of and types of interactions with the company.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="COMMON2"></a>Common CPPs</h2>
        <p>CPPs should include anything the client has stored in their CRM system pertaining to their customers and can be categorized for segmentation. For example:</p>
