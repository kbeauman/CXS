        <h2>Complementary Touchpoints</h2>
        <p>The following touchpoints, when paired with a Purchase measure, have been shown to enhance the breadth, width, and scope of the solution ForeSee offers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li value="1"><b>Fulfillment</b> - Once a visitor makes an online purchase, the next step is to successfully deliver that product to its rightful owner. A Fulfillment measure provides insights on that fulfillment experience - defining how expectations set at the time of purchase may or may not be met.</li>
            <li value="2"><b>Checkout or Cart Abandon</b> - Conversion is not always an indicator that the process for getting that the purchase point was efficient. A poor checkout or cart experience could be preventing a high proportion of visitors from ever completing a purchase. Measuring those experiences separately provides strategic insights into improving these processes.</li>
            <li value="3"><b>Browse Measure</b> - Providing visitors with all the information they need, when they need it, and how they need is important in finalizing their purchase decision.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="GENERAL"></a>General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li value="1">Must have a unique URL or clickable event for the purchase to trigger the purchase survey  at the right time to the right audience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="SURVEY"></a>Survey Statistics</h2>
        <p>The metrics provided below should be used as a guide - actual response and acceptance rates can vary significantly depending on the type of audience and their propensity to participate in surveys.</p>
        <p><b>Email Acceptance rates</b> - 5-15% (depends on the type of audience, quality of email address, and how soon email is sent after the interaction).</p>
        <p><b>Email Completion Rates</b> - 75-95%</p>
