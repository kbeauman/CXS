        <p class="steps" MadCap:conditions="Default.ScreenOnly"><a href="newSurvey.htm" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">Creating a Feedback Survey</a> &gt; <a href="configureSurvey.htm" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">Collection Methods</a> &gt; <span class="MCBreadcrumbsDivider">Publish a Survey</span></p>
        <p>Going live with a survey is a two-step process where you first migrate the survey to a sub-environment, such as <span class="wintitle">Staging</span> or <span class="wintitle">QA</span>. This allows you the opportunity to review and test the survey before going live. Even if you do not have such an environment, you must perform this initial step. Then publish to <span class="wintitle">Production</span> to display the <span class="wintitle">Feedback Badge</span> on your web site. You may also set up <a href="Alerts.htm" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">Alerts</a> from this page, which is optional. </p>
        <MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/CodeSnippetNote.flsnp" />
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Publish</span> tab offers an optional code snippet for each environment which must be embedded into each of your website templates after you publish. There is also a JavaScript Call Function in the <span class="wintitle">Launch This Survey</span> section to launch the survey from a menu, button, or other user interface element other than the <span class="wintitle">Feedback Badge</span>.</p>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Publish</span> page can be accessed from the <span class="wintitle">Projects</span> page. Click the <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span> icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/Pencil.png" title="Edit icon" alt="edit icon" />) of the desired project and then click <span class="uicontrol">Publish</span>.
            <div class="note">When a project has revisions which have not been published, the <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span> icon is replaced with an alert icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/unPubIcon.png" title="Unpublished Edits Icon" alt="unpublished edits icon" />), which functions the same way.</div></p>
        <h2>Publish Your Project</h2>
        <p>You can use the toggle switch <span class="wintitle">This project is</span> to turn the survey off or on. See <a href="surveyOff.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Turn a Survey Off</a> for additional information.</p>
        <p>To publish a survey:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are publishing a new survey, click <span class="uicontrol">Get the code</span>. The <span class="wintitle">Your Embed Code</span> dialog displays. <ol><li>If you do not have a <span class="wintitle">Staging</span>, <span class="wintitle">QA</span>, or other preliminary environment (server), skip this step. In the <span class="wintitle">Staging Code</span> pane, click <span class="uicontrol">Copy to clipboard </span>and paste the syntax into the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section of each web page in <span class="wintitle">Staging</span> from which to launch the survey in order to test the survey settings. </li><li>In the <span class="wintitle">Production Code</span> pane, click <span class="uicontrol">Copy to clipboard </span>and paste the syntax into the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> section of each live web page  from which to launch the survey.</li><li>Click <span class="uicontrol">I'm done!</span> The dialog closes.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Click the <span class="wintitle">This project is</span> toggle to <span class="option">On</span>. This toggle turns the <span class="wintitle">Feedback Badge</span> off or on and you must complete the publishing process before this setting takes effect.</li>
            <li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Publish</span> button in <span class="wintitle">Step 1: Publish to Staging</span>. Even if there is no preliminary environment (server), this is a necessary first step. When the process completes, the <span class="uicontrol">Publish</span> button in <span class="wintitle">Step 2: Publish to Production</span> is enabled. </li>
            <li>Once testing is complete in <span class="wintitle">Staging</span>, click <span class="uicontrol">Publish to Production</span>. When the process completes, a time stamp displays and <span class="uicontrol">Publish to Production</span> becomes disabled.</li>
            <li>Go to the targeted web page(s) and verify the badge displays according to your settings. If the page was open before you published, you may need to refresh the page.</li>
            <li>Optionally, click <span class="uicontrol">Set up Alerts</span> to set up notifications for the project. See <a href="Alerts.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Alerts</a> for additional information.</li>
