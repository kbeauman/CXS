        <h1>ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Replay</h1>
        <p><span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Replay</span> is a video recording of a survey respondent's visit to your web site, with some features and functionality to help in the analysis of the session. These recordings are available on the <span class="wintitle">See Respondents</span> tab of your <a href="../cxSuite/surveyTOC.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Surveys</a> dashboard, where you can click the <span class="wintitle">Replay</span> icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/movieIcon.png" title="Replay icon" alt="replay icon" />) to launch.</p>

        <p><span class="wintitle">Replay</span> presents an added perspective on a survey respondent's experience and often highlights trouble spots where visitors are consistently experiencing issues with the site. With <span class="wintitle">Replay</span>, you can visually compare the mouse clicks or touches, mouse movement, and page scrolling of an individual session to that of the usage pattern for all sessions. </p>
        <p>When a site visitor completes a survey, a recording of their interaction with the web site is transferred to <span class="wintitle">ForeSee's</span> database. In cases such as <span class="wintitle">Feedback</span>, where the survey is completed before the end of the visit or session, the recording is transferred when the respondent leaves the site.</p>
        <p>You can omit one or more pages of your web site from being record by entering the page address in the <span class="wintitle">Do not monitor the following page URLs</span> text box on the <span class="wintitle">Site Settings</span> tab in <span class="wintitle">Global Settings</span>.

        <p><span class="wintitle">Replay</span> uses the <span class="wintitle">Web Based Player</span> to display these recordings, which offers a number of display options and tools to help with the analysis of the respondent's session.
