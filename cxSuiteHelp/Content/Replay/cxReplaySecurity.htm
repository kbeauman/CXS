        <h1>ForeSee<sup>&#174;</sup> Replay Security</h1>
        <p>The intended purpose of <span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>&#174;</sup> Replay</span> video recordings is to illustrate an individual's interaction with a web page in order to identify problematic elements of the page. In doing so, it is impossible to omit or avoid the capture of sensitive information.</p>
        <p>In order to protect the personal information of survey respondents, all text fields and other types of user input elements are rendered to an illegible state in the actual recording. To accomplish this, <span class="wintitle">Replay</span> uses a variety of methods to hide areas of the web pages where personal information might be entered. For example, text characters may be converted to all x's and profile images may be blurred. These changes take place in the browser of the respondent's device before the recording is transmitted to the database. This process cannot be reversed and the mask cannot be removed.</p>
        <div class="note">When changes are made to the layout of a web page, thorough testing is required by the party performing these revisions to ensure all input elements continue to be masked.</div>
        <p>Some types of elements targeted for masking by default are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Text Fields</li>
            <li>User Name</li>
            <li>Profile Images</li>
            <li>Location</li>
            <li>Checkout Flows, i.e., what method a shopper uses to pay for their order.</li>
        </ul>
