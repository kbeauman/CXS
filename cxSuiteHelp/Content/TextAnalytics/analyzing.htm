        <h1>Analyzing Data</h1>
        <p>When you configure <span class="wintitle">Text Analytics</span> to be applied to certain surveys and questions, the <span class="wintitle">Text Analytics</span> engine processes the comments and the <span class="wintitle">Text Analytics</span> insights are available in the dashboard for review.</p>
        <div class="note">If you are a new user to <span class="wintitle">Text Analytics</span>, no data is available to review in the dashboard unless you have selected the measure and questions for analysis in the Settings tab. </div>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Text Analytics</span> section of <span class="wintitle">CX Suite</span> consists of the <span class="wintitle">Topics</span> and <span class="wintitle">Keywords</span> dashboards, and offers a filter ribbon containing the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="wintitle">Measure Menu</span> - Click the displayed measure to open a menu of available measures to select from.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Topics</h2>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Topics</span> dashboard displays taxonomy data on the following cards:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="wintitle">Topics Overview</span> - A horizontal bar chart showing the top five positive and negative topics for the selected date range.  </li>

Mouse over each bar to see total number of comments for the day and a breakdown of positive, negative, and neutral sentiment. By default, data from all topics are included. The menu in the upper-right corner of the card allows you to focus on a selected topic.</li>
            <li><span class="wintitle">Topic and Comments</span> - The data on this card is divided into two tabs:<ul><li><span class="wintitle">Topics</span> - A list of <a href="about.htm#Taxonomy" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">High-Level Themes</a> displays with a horizontal bar showing three sentiment levels, the number of comments, overall sentiment, and overall satisfaction.

Each <span class="wintitle">Mid-Level Theme</span> may also be clicked to display the <span class="wintitle">Topics</span> associated with the theme. At any point in the drill-down, you can click to display the <span class="wintitle">Comments</span> tab and view all comments associated with either the <span class="wintitle">High-Level Theme</span>, <span class="wintitle">Mid-Level Theme</span>, or <span class="wintitle">Topic</span>.</li><li><span class="wintitle">Comments</span> - A list of open end responses to the displayed question. This list contains the comment itself, the date which the comment was submitted,  the Sentiment of the comment, and the overall Satisfaction Score given by the respondent.

        </ul>
        <h2>Keywords</h2>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Keywords</span> dashboard displays data on the following cards:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="wintitle">Keyword Wordcloud</span> - Displays the most commonly used words in size proportion of frequency and color coded according to the overall sentiment of the open ends each word is used. For example, if several respondents are reporting an issue where they clicked on a link and nothing happened, you might see the word "click" appearing in red and in a larger size.<p>This card offers two types of displays, <span class="wintitle">Wordcloud</span> and <span class="wintitle">Treemap</span>, as well as buttons for the number of words to display.</p></li>
            <li><span class="wintitle">Top Keywords</span> - A bar chart of the top 10 words during the selected time span, showing the amount of positive, neutral, and negative statements in which the word was used.

When a search is applied to show a specific word, this word is included in the chart regardless of its frequency.<p>Hover over each bar to view the breakdown of positive, neutral, and negative occurrences.</p></li>
            <li><span class="wintitle">Comments</span> - A list of open end responses to the displayed question.
