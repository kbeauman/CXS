    <body>Pooling is a concept introduced with <a href="../../Replay/cxReplay.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Replay</a>. This concept is similar to the Sampling Percentage where a random number is generated to determine who should receive an invitation. However, with pooling replay eligibility is determined on the first page. If a user is not selected on the first page they do not receive an invitation. If they are selected on the first page they are then eligible to receive the invitation if they fall within the loyalty and sampling parameters.</body>
