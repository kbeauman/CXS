        <p>In <span class="wintitle">CX Suite</span>, a <span class="wintitle">Role</span> is a set of permissions you can assign to individual users. For example, a <span class="wintitle">Role</span> named <span class="wintitle">Executive</span> may contain permission to access all of your <span class="wintitle">CX Suite</span> products and data at the highest level of your organization's hierarchy.
