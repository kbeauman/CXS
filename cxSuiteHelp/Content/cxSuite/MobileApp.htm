        <h3>Logging into the ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Mobile App:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tap the <span class="wintitle">ForeSee</span> icon on your screen. The <span class="wintitle">Login</span> page displays.</li>
            <li>Type your existing <span class="wintitle">ForeSee</span><span class="wintitle">User Name</span> and <span class="wintitle">Password</span>.</li>

        <h3>CX Pulse</h3>
        <p>As the default landing screen, <span class="wintitle">CX Pulse</span> is comprised of the first six measures listed alphabetically, and their scores. Below the list a notation on the measure which experienced the greatest change in score for the time period. Continuing down the screen is the <span class="uicontrol">See All Measures</span> link to the <a href="#CX" title="Click to view this section." alt="Click to view this section.">CX Journey</a> screen. The bottom two sections contain the <span class="wintitle">Recommended Priorities by Measure</span> card and, for clients with <span class="wintitle">Feedback</span>, a summary of those responses.</p>
        <p><span class="wintitle">Recommended Priorities by Measure</span> is a spot light on the measure with the highest <span class="wintitle">Priority Ratio</span> score. This is derived from the monthly stored impacts that <span class="wintitle">Customer Satisfaction</span> score (<span class="wintitle">CSAT</span>) has on the <span class="wintitle">Likelihood to Recommend</span> and the <span class="wintitle">CSAT</span> score itself.</p>

        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Voice of Customer Feed</span> screen lists all open ends from both <span class="wintitle">CX Measurement</span> and <span class="wintitle">Feedback</span> surveys. Responses may be sorted by date (newest first), lowest score, and highest score.</p>
