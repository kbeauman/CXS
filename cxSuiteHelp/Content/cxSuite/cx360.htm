        <h1>CX 360 Dashboard</h1>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> CX 360 Dashboard</span> displays for <span class="wintitle">CX Measurement</span> clients logging into <span class="wintitle">CX Suite</span>. This multi-channel view is designed to give business leaders a snapshot of priorities  and performance across their business. The dashboard consists of two cards: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <span class="wintitle">Recommended Priorities</span> card identifies the priority across all <span class="wintitle">CX Measure</span> surveys to highlight what part of your business needs immediate attention.  </li>
            <li>The <span class="wintitle">CX Journey</span> card displays the customer journey view, which is an ordered sequence across your measures, and compares each measure’s performance to industry benchmarks and <span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Top Performers</span>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> CX 360 Dashboard</span> can be exported into a slide show presentation format for ease and readiness in socializing data throughout your organization.</p>
        <h2>Recommended Priorities</h2>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Recommended Priorities by CX Measure</span> card is a result of applying the <span class="wintitle">Priority Ratio</span> across all <span class="wintitle">CX Measure</span> surveys so you can quickly identify which part of your business needs more or less of your attention.  The <span class="wintitle">Recommended Priorities by CX Measure</span> card includes all of your active measures that have <span class="wintitle">Satisfaction</span>, <span class="wintitle">Likelihood to Recommend</span> in the model, and <span class="wintitle">Impacts</span> calculated. The <span class="wintitle">Priority Ratio</span> is calculated by taking the monthly stored impacts that <span class="wintitle">Customer Satisfaction</span> score (<span class="wintitle">CSAT</span>) has on the <span class="wintitle">Likelihood to Recommend</span> divided into the <span class="wintitle">CSAT</span>, and multiplied by 100.   This product is then rounded to the tenth decimal point and then sorted in descending order. You see your most important priority first and your least important priority last.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <ul>
                <li><span class="wintitle">Likelihood to Recommend</span> = 4.5</li>
                <li><span class="wintitle">CSAT</span> = 70</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Formula: (4.5/70)*100 = 6.428571428571429. The <span class="wintitle">Priority Ratio</span> is 6.4.</p>
        </div>
        <p>To view details about each measure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">More Information</span> icon (...) to display details without leaving the dashboard, such as the measure’s <span class="wintitle">Impact Date Range</span>, <span class="wintitle">N Count</span>, <span class="wintitle">CSAT Score</span>, <span class="wintitle">Rank Ratio</span>, and <span class="wintitle">Measure Activation Date</span>.  </li>
            <li>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Analyze Survey</span> link to display the <a href="MeasuresDashboard.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Measures Dashboard</a> for analysis of the specific survey.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Recommended Priorities by CX Measure</span> card only shows the ranking of active measures with calculated impacts. However, you can also keep track of active measures still in the process of collecting enough n count to calculate impacts, which is 300. There are two messages within the card to aid in this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The number of measure included and the total measures available are displayed along the top of the card. </li>
            <li>A reminder at the end of the carousel to keep track of the progress.  Click the <span class="uicontrol">See Progress</span> link or the <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span> icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/SettingsIcon.png" title="Settings icon" alt="settings icon" />) to display the <span class="wintitle">Settings</span> dialog containing which measures are not included and the status of the measure in reaching the minimum n count.  The <span class="wintitle">Settings</span> dialog also offers the configuration options to hide or show each measure in the card.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>CX Journey</h2>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">CX Journey</span> card displays the customer journey view in an ordered sequence across your measures.  This card compares each measure's performance to industry <span class="wintitle">Benchmark Average</span> and the <span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Top Performers</span>. Measures display in an interactive bar chart: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hover over a score to view details, such as the <span class="wintitle">CSAT</span>, <span class="wintitle">N Count</span>, and date range.</li>
            <li>Click on a specific measure in the bar chart to display the <a href="MeasuresDashboard.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Measure Dashboard</a> and easily drill in to analyze the survey in more detail. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To customize this view:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For measures of less interest, you can control which measures display in the CX Journey card. Click the <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span> icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/SettingsIcon.png" title="Settings icon" alt="settings icon" />) and clicking the <span class="uicontrol">Hide/Show</span> toggle.</li>
            <li>The <span class="wintitle">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Website Index Benchmark Category</span> displays by default, but other categories are available.  Click the <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span> icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/SettingsIcon.png" title="Settings icon" alt="settings icon" />) and select the desired <span class="uicontrol">Benchmark Category</span> to display per measure in the <span class="wintitle">CX Journey</span> card.</li>
        </ul>
