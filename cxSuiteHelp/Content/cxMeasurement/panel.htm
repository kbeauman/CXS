        <h1>Panel Deployment</h1>
        <p>In the context of ForeSee, a panel is a group of people with shared/similar experiences whom are accessed through a third party panel provider and ForeSee partner. See the current partner list under <a href="#GENERAL" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]">General Information</a> for the purpose of surveying.  ForeSee utilizes Panel Sample primarily for Competitive Studies or syndicated research projects (such as FXI).</p>
        <h2><a name="HOW"></a>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>Instead of deploying the survey ourselves, ForeSee works with a panel company who can leverage their relationships with the panel participants to ensure that our survey is only shown to respondents who fit into the predefined target audience group(s).  We develop the survey to look and act the same way it would if we were going to be in charge of the deployment.  The panel company fields the survey through any number of deployment options they have at their disposal, and as the data comes in, it is loaded into the portal the same way it would be if we had deployed the survey ourselves.  Once the agreed upon number of completed surveys has been met, we turn off the collection process on our end and the panel company’s part in the study/measure is done.</p>
        <h2><a name="WHAT2"></a>What Touchpoint Measures Use It?</h2>
        <p>Here are a few touchpoints where this deployment may be common:</p>
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <p>Products for which it is an Alternative Deployment Options:</p>
        <ul>

        <h2><a name="GENERAL"></a>General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Our current Panel partners are:<ul><li>Federated Sample</li><li>Research Now</li><li>GMI</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>CPPs:</b> Determine whether any additional parameters which the panel company can provide need to be passed with the respondent, for example: Age, Sex, Origin, Region, etc. There is a set that the panel company does provide at no cost. These are the only parameters that should be included unless otherwise negotiated and specified within the contract.</li>
            <li><b>Implementation Timeline:</b> Panel Studies are subject to prioritization and timing constraints which are agreed upon prior to implementation.</li>
            <li><b>Quota Stops:</b> ForeSee controls the quota stops for completed surveys.  This is a automatic process that can be set up in the system by the production team or the analyst.  It is typical to have a handful of extra completes beyond the contractually agreed upon amount.  </li>
            <li>Click to view this web site. Typically, the analyst activates the measure for the client when the fielding has stopped. The analyst is then able to see the data in the Portal during the fielding and has access to daily completes summaries.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="PANEL"></a>Panel Specific Terminology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Quota:</b> The number of completed responses contractually  required for each brand/target audience group included in the study.</li>
            <li><b>Over Quota:</b> The number of completed responses over the contractually required amount.  </li>
            <li><b>Soft Launch:</b> An initial test fielding of the survey by the panel company to assess response to the survey.</li>
            <li><b>Live Date:</b> The full launch of the survey by the panel company.  Follows the soft launch.</li>
            <li><b>Qualifier:</b>  Also called qualifier page, these are the questions that determine whether or not the panel participant meets the criteria specified by the client for each of the target audience groups in the study.</li>
            <li><b>Terminate:</b> The page a potential respondent receives when they do not meet the survey eligibility criteria.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="PANEL2"></a>Panel Study Scoping</h2>
        <p>ForeSee will work with the client to answer the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Which target audience groups to include in the study?<ul><li>Typically 3-5 maximum, though just one target audience for Loyalty and CRM measures is standard.</li></ul></li>
            <li>What is the number of completed surveys desired per target audience group?<ul><li>Typically, 300, 500, or 700 per group.</li></ul></li>
            <li>What is the geographic area of collection?</li>
            <li>What are the qualifying requirements to be met by respondents (e.g., have visited one of the brand’s websites within the past 30 days)?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="SURVEY"></a>Survey Statistics</h2>
        <p>There are no real survey statistics for a panel study, such as acceptance rate or response rate, that are collected since the panel is tasked with getting the survey to the correct individuals.</p>
