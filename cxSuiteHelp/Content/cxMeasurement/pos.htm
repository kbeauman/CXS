        <h1>Point Of Sale</h1>
        <p>Point of Sale (POS) is a deployment option which uses a transaction receipt to offer the survey to the respondent.</p>
        <h2><a name="HOW"></a>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <p>POS deployment uses either a physical receipt or an eReceipt to offer the customer the ability to take a survey.  The “call to action” (i.e., Survey Invite) is presented through either a URL, IVR survey toll-free number, or both depending on the desired solution.</p>
        <p>The receipt contains information that must be entered into the survey landing page to be validated in order to take the survey, e.g., transaction date, store number, and transaction number.  Once the customer inputs the required information they are allowed to take the survey.  This approach deters survey fraud and repeat entries from the same receipt.</p>
        <h2><a name="SAMPLE"></a>Sample Receipt #1</h2>
        <p>In this sample receipt, the customer must input the store number, transaction number, and date into the survey landing page before having access to the survey.</p>

        </p>
        <h2><a name="SAMPLE2"></a>Sample Receipt #2</h2>
        <p>In this sample receipt, the customer only needs to input the receipt code into the survey landing page.  This receipt code incorporates all the required info (store number, transaction code, transaction date) into one string so the customer does not need to look at different locations on the receipt for each piece of information.</p>

        <h2><a name="GENERAL"></a>General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The client must facilitate the process of getting the ForeSee survey information, such as the hyperlink or <a href="ivr.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">IVR</a> phone number and code on the POS receipt. A vanity URL may also be used if the client wishes to provide one to ForeSee during the survey deployment process.</li>
            <li>If the POS allows for an eReceipt, an <a href="email.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Email Deployment</a> of the survey may also be an option.</li>
            <li>Client can have both IVR and URL deployment option on the same receipt.</li>
            <li>URL survey data remains separate from IVR survey data in the Portal if multiple deployment types are used.</li>
            <li>We can make sure there are no duplicate submissions regardless of the number of deployment types used due to a unique receipt/transaction code.</li>
            <li>Respondent must enter purchase date, store number, and transaction number to participate in the survey.</li>
            <li>Respondents have within seven days of the purchase date to participate in the survey (day of purchase counts as day one).</li>
        </ul>
