        <p>Sentiment Analytics takes open-ended comments from a ForeSee<sup>&#174;</sup> customer experience measurement and processes them through a natural language processor to visually and conveniently reveal critical topics, keywords, and sentiment.  This capability works in tandem with the predictive and quantified measurement system relied upon by ForeSee<sup>&#174;</sup> clients.  Users have instant access to Sentiment Analytics within their ForeSee<sup>&#174;</sup> portal, providing immediate views of aggregate and respondent-level insights that drive more depth behind key satisfaction drivers impacting customer experiences.</p>
        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>This natively integrated capability allows brands to deeply understand and act upon the intensity of the customer experience in the context of a predictive and prioritized framework. Sentiment Analytics benefits organizations by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Simplifying the task of quantifying open-ended comments.</li>
            <li>Enabling deeper segment analysis by joining text-based insights to quantified metrics.</li>
            <li>Comparing overall sentiment to changes in customer experience programs over time.</li>
            <li>Surfacing potential language to marketing and communication teams who benefit from knowing how topics and keywords resonate with targeted communities and customer groups.</li>
            <li>Equipping Research or Customer Insights teams with visual data justifying the awareness among other functional teams when certain topics or keywords warrant attention.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="TARGET"></a>Target Audience</h2>
        <h3>Research / CX Analysts / CI Teams</h3>
        <p>Relevant Concerns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detecting opportunities or risks buried within verbatims.</li>
            <li>Interpreting comments in the context of other reliable risk indicators.</li>
            <li>Lengthy time spent reading or coding open-ends.</li>
            <li>Accessing text analysis results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How does Sentiment Analytics benefit them?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dashboards conveniently visualize the nature of customer conversations and their sentiment.</li>
            <li>Comments can be examined for identified segments already known to be helpful or harmful to a client's future.</li>
            <li>Categories are created for them - keywords and topics are extracted and quantified based on their frequency and sentiment.</li>
            <li>It's built right into AAP.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Customer Service Teams</h3>
        <p>Relevant Concerns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improving customer services.</li>
            <li>Missing certain pieces of customer feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How does Sentiment Analytics benefit them?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Negative keywords, topics, or full comments can be shared based on their overall sentiment. This can prevent potential customer loss/defections.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Marketing</h3>
        <p>Relevant Concerns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating relevant and targeted communications.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How does Sentiment Analytics benefit them?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Highlighted language from a segment-level analysis can inform future copy writing or bring up concepts relevant to the studied segment (e.g., highly positive keywords tied to a product-shopping segment might warrant future use in advertising or on product description pages).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Additional blocks of 300,000 open-ends per month. Pricing is for 1.5 million API calls per month - but each verbatim requires five API calls.</p>
        <div class="note">Majority of clients do not need this.</div>
        <h2><a name="GENERAL"></a>General Information</h2>
        <h3>Key Capabilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Filter-driven Sentiment Analytics (using the filtering mechanisms within AAP).</li>
            <li>Question-driven Sentiment Analytics (tying the data back to cxMeasurement Metrics).</li>
            <li>Word cloud keyword visualization.</li>
            <li>Focusing and managing content (keyword and topic extraction).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Configurations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Product Applications: Can be utilized on an open-end comments collected through cxMeasure products (including legacy Feedback). Not available on new Feedback at this time.</li>
            <li>Contract Scope: If a client purchases Sentiment Analytics - it is applicable to all of their cxMeasures and all of their assigned portal users.</li>
            <li>Portal Access: Only available within the AAP at this time.</li>
            <li>Language: Only available on U.S. English comments at this time. We do not offer translation services for open-ends.</li>
            <li>Hosted Code: Does not require hosted code or code at all. Can be utilized on any cxMeasure OE data populated to AAP.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Deployment</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Client must have a signed contract to allow for Sentiment Analytics access to be granted.</li>
            <li>Assigned CS contact must submit a ticket to DOT to have access assigned to the client’s user(s).</li>
            <li>Two levels of users are available - Administrative and Viewer.<ul><li>Administrative access allows for: 1) determination of which open-end questions can be run using Sentiment Analytics and 2) viewing of usage metering.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>ForeSee<sup>&#174;</sup> employees can be granted access to client’s Sentiment Analytics - but caution should be used around Foresee verses client usage and the volume of OE’s they have.</p>
