        <h1>ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Public API</h1>
        <p>The ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Public API enables you to programmatically access your ForeSee data using a secure, direct connection. This connection provides access to both respondent and aggregate level data. Application Program Interface (API) is a simple, flexible way to connect and pull Voice of Customer data. You have the flexibility to make API calls as frequently as you like, and get data for range of time, as well as incorporate this data pull in your IT processes.</p>
        <p>The data is provided in JSON format, which is easy to extract and provides the freedom to use the data in a way that best fits your needs.</p>
        <p>The  ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Developer Portal details the API, including information for all API endpoints, call parameters, return data examples, and sample  code snippets. The ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Developer Portal can be accessed publicly here:  <a href="http://developer.foresee.com/docs-articles/public-api/" target="_blank" title="Click to view this web site." alt="Click to view this web site.">http://developer.foresee.com/docs-articles/public-api/</a></p>
        <p>In order to use the ForeSee<sup>®</sup> API, you need API specific credentials from ForeSee. You may work with your ForeSee contact or reach out to <a href="http://support.foresee.com/contact" target="_blank" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Web Site%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Web Site%]">ForeSee<sup>®</sup> Support</a> for help with obtaining API credentials.</p>
        <p>Once you have access to the API, it is recommended to review ForeSee’s documentation, which includes code samples that have proven to be beneficial to many of our clients. These code samples are in several programming languages to provide an understanding of the syntax used in the ForeSee<sup>®</sup> API.</p>
        <p>If you experience API connection issues while developing your code to connect to the ForeSee<sup>®</sup> API, please provide the specific steps taken and any error or response message that results.</p>
