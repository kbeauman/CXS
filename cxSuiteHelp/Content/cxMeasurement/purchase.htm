        <h1>Purchase</h1>
        <p>Purchase measures the satisfaction with the shopping and ordering experience among visitors who completed an in-channel purchase.</p>
        <p>Available in These Channels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web</li>

        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>Satisfaction with the purchase experience determines whether a customer will buy from a company again. ForeSee’s Purchase measure for web or mobile can help companies discover what customers who just purchased online from them like and don't like about the purchase experience and support so that they can build a base of loyal online customers.</p>

        <h2>Complementary Touchpoints</h2>
        <p>The following touchpoints, when paired with a Purchase measure, have been shown to enhance the breadth, width, and scope of the solution ForeSee offers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fulfillment</b> - Once a visitor makes an online purchase, the next step is to successfully deliver that product to its rightful owner. A Fulfillment measure provides insights on that fulfillment experience - defining how expectations set at the time of purchase may or may not be met.</li>
            <li><b>Checkout or Cart Abandon</b> - Conversion is not always an indicator that the process for getting that the purchase point was efficient. A poor checkout or cart experience could be preventing a high proportion of visitors from ever completing a purchase. Measuring those experiences separately provides strategic insights into improving these processes.</li>
            <li><b>Browse Measure</b> - Providing visitors with all the information they need, when they need it, and how they need is important in finalizing their purchase decision.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="GENERAL"></a>General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Must have a unique URL or clickable event for the purchase to trigger the purchase survey  at the right time to the right audience.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="SURVEY"></a>Survey Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/SurveyStats.flsnp" />
        </p>
        <p><b>Email Acceptance rates</b> - 5-15% (depends on the type of audience, quality of email address, and how soon email is sent after the interaction).</p>
        <p><b>Email Completion Rates</b> - 75-95%</p>
