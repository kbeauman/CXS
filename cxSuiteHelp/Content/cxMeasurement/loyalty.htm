        <h2>Complementary Touchpoints</h2>
        <p>The following touchpoints, when paired with a Loyalty measure, have been shown to enhance the breadth, width, and scope of the solution ForeSee offers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Web/Mobile</b> - Digital channels can serve as a key source for members to utilize their achieved rewards or self-service around their membership. Ensuring the digital experience is successful for loyalty members is vital in strengthening a company’s word of mouth.</li>
            <li><b>Contact Center</b> - Loyalty program members may utilize a company’s contact center for assistance with their membership or to make a purchase using their rewards. Ensuring that contact center experience is successful reinforces loyalty program participation and drive word of mouth.</li>
            <li><b>In-Location Store</b> - Stores often act as the main acquisition source for loyalty program enrollment. Understanding how these two experiences complement each other is important.</li>
