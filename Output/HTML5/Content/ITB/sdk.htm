                        <ul>
                            <li value="1">The SDK code controls the following:<ul><li value="1">Sampling Parameters</li><li value="2">Survey Definitions</li><li value="3">Survey Invitations</li><li value="4">Client Logo on Invitation</li><li value="5">ForeSee Logo on Invitation</li><li value="6">CPPs</li><li value="7">Languages</li></ul></li>
                            <li value="2">Once the code has been downloaded, any changes are the responsibility of the client, apart from the sampling percentage, which is ours.</li>
                            <li value="3">If a respondent receives an invitation/survey and then an app update is pushed, this data is stored in the app storage so we will not invite again.</li>
                            <li value="4">We cannot host SDK codes.  The only exception to this is  Hybrid apps, though it is rare so check with Mobile SME and Vancouver office prior to presenting this as an option.</li>
                            <li value="5">Our SDKs only support iOS and Android operating systems. These have been approved by Apple and Google.  They do not support Blackberry, Symbian, or Windows Phone.</li>
                            <li value="6">ForeSee does not support PhoneGap (Cordova) style applications.  Clients can instrument their PhoneGap application on the platforms we support using native SDK.</li>
                            <li value="7">We do not offer custom configurations for our SDKs, though the client is free to do custom configurations on their end.<div class="example">An example of this would be configuring a time variable, such as somebody must be on the app for 30 seconds before receiving an invitation.</div></li>
                            <li value="8">Application Replay is delivered within an SDK instead of a code package.  It utilizes a series of screen captures (up to 80MB) to recreate the experience the user had on the app.</li>
                            <li value="9">In the ON_EXIT invitation mode, the user is assumed to have completed the survey as soon as they accept the invitation since there is no way for the SDK to know if they follow the link they have been sent.</li>

After submitting the information to the ForeSee servers, the invitation is dismissed and the user is sent back into the app. No survey presents in this mode. Instead, after a period of time, the user is sent an email or an SMS text message with a link to the survey.<ul><li value="1">Client surveys must be configured on the ForeSee servers for this option to work properly.

                        <p><b>How long do we store email and mobile phone numbers captured through the Mobile On-Exit invitation process?</b> - There is a daily job that runs everyday at 11:00 PM to remove all contact information (email or phone number) older than sysdate -1 (which means its removed every 24 hours). If a client has a reminder policy set up, then contact information is saved in our system as sysdate -1-reminder_interval (which means that the email is saved until the reminder date is met and then removed within 24 hours).</p>
                        <p><b>Where is this information stored?</b> - The information is saved in an Oracle table, stored in encrypted tablespace. There is very limited access to this data internally. All access is logged and tracked.</p>
                        <p><b>Is this location subject to a backup process? If so, how frequently is the data backed up and how long is the backup data stored?</b> - We do run oracle database backup everyday, the backup is stored for five days.</p>
                        <p><b>Do we process these invitations through an internal system or utilize a third party (e.g., SendGrid, CallFire) to send the invitations?</b> - Through a third party system.  SendGrid for Email.  GroupTexting for SMS.</p>
                        <p><b>If we utilize a third party, do we have NDA, MSA, etc. in place with that third party?</b> - We are still exploring this with Legal.</p>
                        <h2><a name="SUPPORT"></a>Support Guidelines</h2>
                        <p>When an issue has arisen with a client's in-app implementation, the best first step is to gather information about what happened. Some good initial questions to ask are:</p>
                        <h3>When did the issue start? Was there some change you made in your app code?</h3>
                        <p>This will allow you to determine if the issue arose because of something the client has done, or some external issue.</p>
                        <h3>Does the issue persist if you uninstall and reinstall the app?</h3>
                        <p>Clients often forget that the SDK has a state. Uninstalling and reinstalling the app is a quick and easy way to see if the state is causing the confusion. If the problem is solved after this resetting of state, you should mention to the client that once one invitation is shown, the <a href="http://developer.foresee.com/docs-articles/android-sdk/trigger/repeat-days/" target="_blank" title="Click to view this web site." alt="Click to view this web site.">repeatDays</a> threshold must be met before a new invitation is shown.</p>
                        <h3>What version of our SDK are you using?</h3>
                        <p>This allows us to be able to mirror the client's setup by stepping back to the version they are using.</p>
                        <h3>Is there a problem with the configuration?</h3>
                        <p>Ask the client to send you their configuration JSON. From this you can often tell where things might be going wrong.</p>
                        <h3>What platform is this happening on? iOS, Android, or both?</h3>
                        <p>This is useful for the same reason as understanding the version, but if the issue is happening on both, it's more likely to be something external to both the client's code and our SDK code since it's unlikely the same issue would crop up in two different implementations. Of course, that's not a guarantee, as we've seen with previous clients.</p>
                        <h3>What notification type are you using?</h3>
                        <p>On iOS, local notifications can cause confusion because the user may have previously declined local notifications and therefore the invitation does not show. Because this setting is hard to reset, this confusion can extend even after the app is uninstalled. See <a href="http://developer.foresee.com/docs-articles/android-sdk/configuration/configuration/" target="_blank" title="Click to view this web site." alt="Click to view this web site.">Configuration Options</a> for more information.</p>
                        <h3>Are you using a cross-platform development language?</h3>
                        <p>Cross platform frameworks such as Xamarin, Cordova (PhoneGap), Appcelerator, etc. can all cause problems with our SDK. Although we do not officially support these platforms, there are possible ways to implement with them and some support can be given.</p>
                        <h2><a name="EXCLUSIO"></a>Exclusions</h2>
                        <p>For web based SDK, page exclusions can be based on things such as specific URLs, referring domains, browsers, cookies, etc.  These are not applicable to in-app SDK.  In-app SDK depends on a command to show the invitation.  This command must be placed in any place the invitation is required to show.</p>
                        <p>Because of this, it is also impossible to execute global exclusions based on IP address (this is usually done when trying to exclude internal IP addresses).</p>
                        <h2><a name="COOKIES"></a>Cookies</h2>
                        <p>Cookies do not really exist as such in apps. Although we do store a state and keep a count of the measurement criteria, it's done with persistent storage rather than cookies.</p>
                        <h2><a name="SAMPLING"></a>Sampling Parameters</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li value="1">Sampling percentage works in a similar way to web measures: Once the eligibility criteria has been met (launch count, significant events, etc), the user is sampled according to a percentage set on our servers. If they pass, they are shown an invitation. If they fail, they are resampled next time they open the app.<div class="note">IS sets sampling percentages for in-app measures.</div></li>
                            <li value="2">The concept of loyalty factor as it applies to web-based trigger code (number of pages into a session) is not applicable to in-app SDK.  Since a loyalty factor does not exist, there is no place in the code to set it.</li>
                            <li value="3">Unlike web-based trigger code, where setting sampling parameters to 0 effectively “turns off” the code, setting any criteria to 0 within the in-app SDK means that the invitation launches immediately (after 0 launches, for example). If the client wants to ignore a criteria, that line should be removed from the configuration.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2><a name="POOLING"></a>Pooling</h2>
                        <p>Pooling doesn’t exist in-app.  All users are recorded, then those recordings are either transmitted or discarded based on their response to the invitation.</p>
                        <p>Since a pooling rate does not exist, there is no place in the code to set it.</p>
                        <h2><a name="EVENT"></a>Event Triggers</h2>
                        <p>Our SDKs have the following built in events for triggering survey invitations:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li value="1">Number of times the app has been launched:<ul><li value="1">The client can select this value themselves via the <a href="http://developer.foresee.com/docs-articles/android-sdk/configuration/configuration/" target="_blank" title="Click to view this web site." alt="Click to view this web site.">configuration file</a> included within the SDK.</li></ul></li>
                            <li value="2">Number of days since the app was launched and installed:<ul><li value="1">The client can select this value themselves via the <a href="http://developer.foresee.com/docs-articles/android-sdk/configuration/configuration/" target="_blank" title="Click to view this web site." alt="Click to view this web site.">configuration file</a> included within the SDK.</li></ul></li>
                            <li value="3">Significant client owned events:<ul><li value="1">e.g., click a specific button, reach a specific page on the app, complete a purchase.</li><li value="2">These events can be anything the client decides.  They are incremented using a command called on the SDK.</li></ul></li>
                            <li value="4">Lifetime Page views:<ul><li value="1">The number of Activity resumes (Android) or ViewController appearances (iOS) in the app.</li><li value="2">After triggering this event based on the count determined by the client, the survey won’t show for another 90 days.  The next time the visitor opens up the app after the 90 days are up, the counter resets.</li></ul></li>
                        </ul>
