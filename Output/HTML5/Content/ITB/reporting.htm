                        <p>The Executive Portal does not have the same type of automatic reporting capabilities as AAP.  Within the EP, dashboards function as reports, with the ability to create custom dashboards and then share them, either as a link that opens up a web page or a PDF image of the dashboard.</p>

                        <p><b>PDF Download</b> -  The recipient can save the dashboard as a PDF document. Each dashboard tile is placed on a separate page with all the metadata displayed, i.e., the header is expanded. However, drill-down data is not available in a PDF.</p>
