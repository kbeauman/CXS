                <ol>
                    <li>Replay selection is unchanged and can be found in the following illustration. Each respondent with a replay has the associated <span class="uicontrol">Replay</span> icon (<img src="Resources/Images/SR_icon.png" alt="SessionReplay Icon" />) next to the corresponding survey line item. Click this icon to launch the <span class="wintitle">Web Based Player</span>. The <span class="uicontrol">Multiple Replays</span> icon (<img src="Resources/Images/SR_MultiReplayIcon.png" alt="Session Replay Multiple Replay icon" />) indicates two or more sessions are available for a single responded, which display in a dialog when you click the icon.</li>
                    <li style="page-break-before: always;">All <span class="wintitle">Segmentation Filters</span> can be built and saved for reuse (see <a href="Creating_a_Filter.htm" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">Filtering</a> for additional information). Filter criteria can be applied to the <span class="wintitle">Heat Mapping</span> functionality, please see section <a href="Session_Replay_Advanced.htm" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">Advanced Functions</a> of this guide for additional details.</li>

                        <img alt="Respondents Tab" src="Resources/Images/SR_Respondents2.png" height="666" width="810" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 600px;max-height: auto; }" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" title="Click to view." />
                    </div>
                    <li>In addition to <span class="wintitle">Segmentation Filters</span>,  <span class="wintitle">Page Filters</span> are available only to clients having <span class="wintitle">cxReplay</span>, which may be built and saved for reuse. <span class="wintitle">Page Filters</span> and <span class="wintitle">Segmentation Filters</span> work together and can be layered on top of each other to focus on a specific result set based upon the <span class="wintitle">Segmentation Filter</span> criteria and the pages interacted with during the session recording. An example of a layered <span class="wintitle">Segmentation Filters</span> and <span class="wintitle">Page Filter</span> may be <span class="userinput">visitors that have a satisfaction score less than 70</span> (<span class="wintitle">Segmentation Filters</span>), and <span class="userinput">interacted with the 'shopping cart' pages</span> (<span class="wintitle">Page Filter</span>).</li>

                    <div class="stepresult">The <span class="wintitle">Page Filters</span> tab is located at the top of the control panel along with the <span class="wintitle">Selections</span> tab. The selected tab is red and the unselected tab is gray.</div>

                        <span class="wintitle">Page Filters</span>, like <span class="wintitle">Segmentation Filters</span>, apply across all of the <span class="wintitle">Insights</span> second-level tabs. </li>

                </ol>
                <p>A <span class="wintitle">Page Filter</span> has four elements:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <span class="wintitle">Name</span>: A name that is used defined (can be private or shared).</li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="wintitle">Entry Page</span>: The ability to filter for the first page visited during a session.</li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="wintitle">Page</span>: The ability to filter for a specific page visited during the session.</li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="wintitle">Exit Page</span>: The ability to filter for the last page visited during a session.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Once a <span class="wintitle">Page Filter</span> is named, the other elements of <span class="wintitle">Entry Page</span>, <span class="wintitle">Page</span>, and <span class="wintitle">Exit Page</span> are treated as equal parts of the criteria. The criteria links each element with an <i class="systemoutput">AND</i> statement, which is executed as <i class="systemoutput">Entry Page AND Page AND Exit Page</i> for the user. The <span class="wintitle">Entry Page</span> and <span class="wintitle">Exit Page</span> elements can have up to three sub-elements, while the <span class="wintitle">Page</span> element can have up to four sub-elements. For example, the visitor interacted with the <span class="wintitle">Marketing Promotion</span> page, the <span class="wintitle">Shoes for Men</span> page, the <span class="wintitle">Shopping Cart</span> page, and the <span class="wintitle">Order Confirmation</span> page. Defining criteria for just one page or all four pages allows the <span class="wintitle">Page Filter</span> to focus on the entire visit and key milestone along the visitor interaction, or just a specific portion of the website.</p>
                <p>
                    <span class="wintitle">Entry Page</span>, <span class="wintitle">Page</span>, and <span class="wintitle">Exit Page</span> can be defined as <span class="wintitle">Page Titles</span> or <span class="wintitle">Page URLs</span>, and are treated as text strings that are matched with either a <span class="option">Contains</span> condition or a <span class="option">Starts With</span> condition. An example of a <span class="option">Contains</span> criterion is <span class="option">Shopping Cart</span>, which looks through the entire HTML page title, and whether or not the text <i class="systemoutput">Shopping Cart</i> appears anywhere in the title. By contrast, the <span class="option">Starts With</span> criteria tries to match the text to the beginning of the HTML page title. The <span class="option">Page URL</span> criterion works the same as the <span class="option">Page Title</span> criterion, only focused on the the entire URL string marking the location of a specific webpage on the website.</p>

                <p>Selecting a <span class="uicontrol">Replay</span> icon (<img src="Resources/Images/SR_icon.png" alt="session replay icon" />) for a session launches a new browser window, referred to as the <span class="wintitle">Web Based Player</span>, which is the primary interface for viewing replays.</p>
                <p>The player consists of two primary types of controls:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The basic <span class="wintitle">Session Controls</span> provide the following functions:
                    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><span class="uicontrol">Page Selector</span> – The ability to move to any page within a given session by selecting a thumbnail. The <span class="uicontrol">Page Selector</span> feature is a control that allows you to see all pages involved in a given replay. This function provides an interactive thumbnail view of each page which allows you to navigate directly to that point in the replay.<div class="stepresult"><img src="Resources/Images/SR_PageSelector.png" title="Page Selector" alt="page selector" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" /></div></li><li><span class="uicontrol">Annotations</span> – A text field to allow reviewers to leave comments for other viewers. The <span class="wintitle">Annotation</span> feature allows you to input comments or observations about a given replay so that they can be preserved for future reference, as well as shared with other users who review your replays. The input function is a simple note taking feature which allows any free form comments that are relevant. A best practice is for each user to leave their initials and date of comment.<div class="stepresult"><img alt="Annotation" src="Resources/Images/SR_Annotations.png" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 280px;max-height: 226px; }" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" title="Click to view." /></div></li><li style="page-break-before: always;"><span class="uicontrol">Heatmaps</span> - The <span class="wintitle">Heatmap</span> allows you to see the most active areas of the screen across multiple user interactions, providing insight on the ease of use and engaging content display of the page. <span class="wintitle">Click</span>, <span class="wintitle">Page Scroll</span>, and <span class="wintitle">Mouse Movement Heatmaps</span> are available for <span class="wintitle">Personal Computer</span> based interactions. Additionally, you can include <span class="wintitle">URL&#160;Parameters</span> and/or <span class="wintitle">Respondent Filters</span>. <span class="wintitle">Touch</span> and <span class="wintitle">Page Scroll Heatmaps</span> are available for mobile device interactions. A more detail description of the capabilities and how to use them is provided in the <a href="Session_Replay_Advanced.htm" title="Click to view this Help topic." alt="Click to view this Help topic.">cxReplay - Advanced Functions</a> section.<div class="stepresult"><img alt="Heatmap" src="Resources/Images/SR_Heatmap.png" height="378" width="672" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 600px;max-height: auto; }" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;max-height: auto;" title="Click to view." /></div></li><li style="page-break-before: always;"><span class="uicontrol">Device Information</span> - <span class="wintitle">Device Information</span> displays key facts about the device type (e.g., Personal Computer, Tablet, or Mobile Phone Handset), the browser (e.g., <span class="wintitle">Safari</span>, <span class="wintitle">Internet Explorer</span>, or <span class="wintitle">Chrome</span>), and the physical orientation of the device (e.g., landscape or portrait) as it changes while the user interacts with the website (if the device is capable of providing this information). The orientation and movement of the device is captured during user interaction, which can be viewed during a session replay.<div class="stepresult"><img src="Resources/Images/SR_Device.png" title="Click to view." alt="Session Replay Device Information" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" /></div></li><li><span class="uicontrol">Full Screen</span>/<span class="uicontrol">Restore</span> - Expand the replay session to full screen. When in <span class="wintitle">Full Screen</span> mode, this control toggles to <span class="uicontrol">Restore</span> to the original size.<div class="stepresult"><img src="Resources/Images/SR_FullScreen.png" title="Full Screen" alt="full screen" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" /></div></li><li><span class="uicontrol">Download</span> - Export the video file to your hard drive.<div class="stepresult"><img src="Resources/Images/SR_Download.png" title="Download Video File" alt="download video file" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" /></div></li></ol></li>
                    <li style="page-break-before: always;">The <span class="wintitle">Session Histogram</span> allows you to <span class="uicontrol">pause</span>/<span class="uicontrol">play</span>, <span class="uicontrol">page forward</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">page backward</span> any given replay. These are standard media player controls which allow the full motion of the replay to be managed. Additionally, these controls have an activity histogram which represents user activity during the session, along with elapsed time and the local time when the session was captured.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li>Time Elapsed and Total viewing time<div class="stepresult"><img src="Resources/Images/SR_ControlsTime.png" title="Elapsed and total viewing time." alt="Elapsed and total viewing time." style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" /></div></li><li>Page Back, Jump Back 15 Seconds, Play/Pause, Jump Forward 15 Seconds, and Page Forward<div class="stepresult"><img src="Resources/Images/SR_ControlsPlay.png" title="Play and Pause" alt="play and pause" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" /></div></li><li>Histogram - Red lines indicate inactivity<div class="stepresult"><img src="Resources/Images/SR_ControlsHistogram.png" title="Histogram" alt="histogram" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" /></div></li><li>Replay Speed - 1x - 20x<div class="stepresult"><img src="Resources/Images/SR_ControlsSpeed.png" title="Speed" alt="speed" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" /></div></li></ol></li>
