Customers receive a small JavaScript snippet that they need to add to their global website templates so that it appears on every page of their website. The purpose of this is to manage the asynchronous loading of any ACS products that you may be using, including ForeSee. The snippet causes a small JavaScript file to be downloaded from the cloud. This file manages the injection of the ForeSee script, which is used to track usage of the site and present survey invitations as needed.</li>

This library contains JavaScript, HTML, CSS, images, and one .swf file. The purpose of this JavaScript library is to present a survey invitation to site users based on the configured requirements. Once a site user has become eligible, based on those requirements, the code then presents the survey invitation and subsequent survey questionnaire (hosted by ForeSee) to the site user.  This library may also contain logic to collect additional client specific data points that are available on the site to be passed along with the survey results through the use of Customer Passed Parameters (CPPs).</li>

Two session cookies which store information relating to the survey control and operation, as well as some basic information such as the number of pages a user has viewed, and the URLs the user was on when they entered and left the site.

                                            <li value="2">A client may want us to pin a checkout and/or purchase definition over a more general browse definition. Checkout and purchase receive less traffic than the overall site, so we want to make sure that anyone who accepted the invitation via the browser definition would receive the checkout or purchase survey if they enter the checkout flow or complete a purchase. The "pin" parameter can accomplish this.</li>
                                            <li value="3">You could still move into a higher priority definition. The code reads the definition from the top down. The higher up a definition is in order, the more priority it has. Once you are pinned to a definition, you can move up to a higher priority definition, but you can't move down.</li>
                                            <li value="4">Using the "lock" parameter in a survey definition allows the code to make sure the definition used to present your survey is the definition that invited you. If the definition that triggers your invitation is using the "lock" parameter set to "1", you will not be able to move up or down into another definition. The definition that triggered the invitation will remain until you trigger an exit condition.</li>

The two most common parameters that may need adjusting are the Loyalty Factor (LF) and the Sampling Percentage (SP). The Loyalty Factor indicates the minimum number of pages a user must visit to receive an invitation. The Sampling Percentage indicates the percentage (random chance) of users who are invited.</li>
                                            <li value="2">The Loyalty Factor must be met for the definition first then the Sampling Percentage in order to receive an invitation.</li>
                                            <li value="3">The operators for Loyalty Factor can include:<ul><li value="1">= An invitation displays only when the Loyalty Factor is exactly this number of page views.</li><li value="2">&gt;= An invitation displays when the Loyalty Factor is this many page views or greater.</li><li value="3">&gt; An invitation displays when the Loyalty Factor is greater than this many page views.</li></ul></li>
                                            <li value="4">The Loyalty Factor increments for both active and inactive tabs. For example, if a visitor has two tabs open for the same website in the same browser window, the tabs aggregate the number of page views to reach the LF. If the visitor has viewed two pages on the first tab and three pages on the second tab, they have a current pages viewed of five.&#160;</li>
                                            <li value="5">By setting the sampling percentage to zero (0), you effectively “turn off the code”. Survey invitations will not present on any page in this situation.&#160;</li>

                                            <li value="1">Pooling is a concept introduced with <a href="replay.htm" title="Click to view this ITB topic." alt="Click to view this ITB topic.">cxReplay</a>. This concept is similar to the Sampling Percentage where a random number is generated to determine who should receive an invitation. However, with pooling replay eligibility is determined on the first page. If a user is not selected on the first page they do not receive an invitation. If they are selected on the first page they are then eligible to receive the invitation if they fall within the loyalty and sampling parameters.</li>
                                            <li value="2">Because pooling immediately excludes some of the visitors from taking a survey no matter the length of their session, we must adjust the sampling percentage up for the survey to account for the fact that fewer people are eligible to take the survey. We start by adjusting the SP in unison with the pooling number. So if the pooling SP is 20% (1/5), we multiply the current sampling rate by five. Then we adjust the SP up for the average number of pages viewed, being larger than one, to account for the increased probability users who are now not in the pool had of getting invited previously.</li>
                                            <li value="3">The trigger code still has an option for pooling even if the client does not have cxReplay.  In this situation the default pooling value is set at 100.</li>

                                        <p>To support the diversity of workflows and policies that customers may have for their website, ForeSee provides the following options for getting code implemented:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li value="1"><b>ForeSee Hosted Code (preferred)</b> - This is the default option and offers the most hands-off experience for the client. In this case, the client makes a small addition to their global website template to link to the hosted JavaScript file.  This method allows all code modifications to be made by ForeSee, without any further changes to the client’s website.  Once the client has added the code snippet to their template, they do not need to revise the template again to receive code updates from us. This is because the embed snippet references the client’s permanent home in the ForeSee cloud.</li>
                                            <li value="2"><b>ForeSee Hosted Code with Versioning</b> - This is similar to the first option, but with each update to the code being given its own unique URL. This gives the client the security of knowing that changes to code hosted in the cloud cannot occur without them explicitly changing their website template. It also means that they must change their template for even the most minor update to triggering behavior. In terms of overall flexibility, this option is less optimal than the first, but still gives them some of the convenience of cloud hosting.</li>

Once you meet the loyalty factor for a definition, you would then qualify for that specific definition after accepting the invite.

Checkout and purchase receive less traffic than the overall site, so we want to make sure that anyone who accepted the invitation via the browser definition would receive the checkout or purchase survey if they enter the checkout flow or complete a purchase. The "pin" parameter can accomplish this.</li>

The two most common parameters that may need adjusting are the Loyalty Factor (LF) and the Sampling Percentage (SP). The Loyalty Factor indicates the minimum number of pages a user must visit to receive an invitation. The Sampling Percentage indicates the percentage (random chance) of users who are invited.</li>

                                            <li value="4">The Loyalty Factor increments for both active and inactive tabs. For example, if a visitor has two tabs open for the same website in the same browser window, the tabs aggregate the number of page views to reach the LF. If the visitor has viewed two pages on the first tab and three pages on the second tab, they have a current pages viewed of five.</li>

                                            <li value="1">Pooling is a concept introduced with <a href="replay.htm" title="Click to view this ITB topic." alt="Click to view this ITB topic.">cxReplay</a>. This concept is similar to the Sampling Percentage where a random number is generated to determine who should receive an invitation. However, with pooling replay eligibility is determined on the first page. If a user is not selected on the first page they do not receive an invitation. If they are selected on the first page they are then eligible to receive the invitation if they fall within the loyalty and sampling parameters.</li>
                                            <li value="2">Because pooling immediately excludes some of the visitors from taking a survey no matter the length of their session, we must adjust the sampling percentage up for the survey to account for the fact that fewer people are eligible to take the survey. We start by adjusting the SP in unison with the pooling number. So if the pooling SP is 20% (1/5), we multiply the current sampling rate by five. Then we adjust the SP up for the average number of pages viewed, being larger than one, to account for the increased probability users who are now not in the pool had of getting invited previously.</li>
                                            <li value="3">The trigger code still has an option for pooling even if the client does not have cxReplay.  In this situation the default pooling value is set at 100.</li>
