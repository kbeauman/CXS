        <h2><a name="WHAT"></a>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>cxCompare is a product that allows clients to obtain a direct comparison of performance metrics (Elements, Satisfaction and Future Behaviors) as well as KPIs (Custom Questions) of a specific experience/channel across 3-5 brands. This is accomplished by partnering with a panel sample provider to deploy our model-based survey to a targeted group of respondents during a specific timeframe.</p>
        <p>Can Measure Experiences in Any of These Channels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web</li>
            <li>Mobile</li>
            <li><a href="contactCenter.htm" title="Click to view this Product Guide topic." alt="Click to view this Product Guide topic.">Contact Center</a>

        </ul>
        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>The competitive study offers insight on competitor strengths so the client can fortify and defend against these strengths. It also offers a glimpse into competitors’ weaknesses, allowing the client to identify areas of opportunity to advance their position in the applicable industry. The unique view of a comparative model, priority map, and segmented analyses across the competition gives our clients a competitive edge. Most importantly, it gives them the ability to move forward in an innovative way guided by the voice of customer.</p>
        <p>cxCompare can help companies gain valuable insights such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What customers value between competing companies.</li>
            <li>The company’s position in the marketplace and how they compare with their competitors.</li>
            <li>Competitors’ customers’ likelihood of switching companies.</li>
            <li>Customer reaction to changes made within the company and competing companies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="TARGET"></a>Target Audience</h2>
        <h3>Strategic Marketing  and Customer Experience Leadership</h3>
        <p>cxCompare provides these teams with competitive intelligence and a unique view of customer experiences with the company in contrast to chosen competitors.  Marketing and Customer Experience leaders want their brands to stand out while differentiating themselves from the competition. To do so, they must gain an understanding of where their competitors are succeeding and failing when it comes to relevant customer experiences.</p>
        <h2><a name="ACTIONAB"></a>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <p>Telecom provider learned that customers looking for help/support are significantly less satisfied than those visiting for sales or account management related tasks, and that a satisfactory online support experience is a weakness across the competitive set. This led to follow-up Insight and Usability Reviews for telecom provider's continuous support measurement to better understand specific improvement opportunities to propel their online support experience ahead of the competition.</p>
        <p>Telecom provider discovered that 1-in-6 customers who were required to login during their site visit, had to try more than once to login, an issue not as prevalent among competitors. As a result, telecom provider requested follow-up Insight and Usability Reviews for their continuous account management measurement to uncover specific improvement opportunities for the login process.</p>
        <p>Telecom provider found that 3-in-10 current customers are considering switching providers, the highest switch consideration among all providers. Further, customers who have been with the provider more than two years express the greatest consideration for switching, but almost half of would-be switchers are willing to give the provider a chance to retain them. As a result, telecom provider understands the significant need to develop customer loyalty retention strategies.</p>

        <h2><a name="GENERAL"></a>General Information</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>There should be a discussion with the client around the qualifying criteria for the panel.<div class="example">e.g., Age 18+, U.S. based email addresses only, balanced among U.S. census, customers who visited a competitor’s site in the past 7 days and completed a specific task, etc.</div></li>
            <li>Model questions and CQs are the same for the client and each competitor regardless of targeted products/service.</li>
