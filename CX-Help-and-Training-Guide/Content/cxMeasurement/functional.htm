        <h2><a name="WHAT"></a>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>cxMeasure - Functional is a single dedicated function-oriented measurement.  For example, a store locator with ratings and reviews would be considered function-oriented website processes the user could engage in.</p>
        <p>Available in These Channels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web</li>
            <li>Mobile</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>Most companies have some form of an online process/tool on their website and often take these tools for granted.  A poorly working tool or process can inhibit a user from accomplishing their task, leading to lower satisfaction and lower future behaviors.  This issue is not industry specific either, whether a company is retail, financial services, or telecom, and whether they are focused on content or ecommerce, a well functioning website is crucial to their bottom line success.</p>
        <h2><a name="TARGET"></a>Target Audience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Web/Mobile Content Managers</li>
            <li>eCommerce Managers</li>
            <li>Web Design Team</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="ACTIONAB"></a>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <p>A financial services company found that two-thirds of site visitors were unsuccessful in the rewards program registration process.  ForeSee’s Functional measure determined that the system was not matching the customer's entered information with their accounts and visitors felt there were too many steps in the process.  The client eliminated one unnecessary step to the process and eliminated two of the required fields that customers needed to enter information into.  The result was a 7% increase in respondents completing the registration process.</p>
        <p>A Federal Government client found that some consumers who were trying to use their Complaint Assistant tool were having issues with the form displaying on their screens properly, causing errors and making it impossible for them to file the complaint.  The root of the issue was that the tool was not compatible with the latest version of Windows.  Improvements were made and satisfaction for the Complaint Assistant process improved from 68 to 77 within two months</p>
        <p>A Consumer Products client determined that low satisfaction with the support section of their website was caused by inadequate functionality of the search tool, specifically, when customers searched for the product by model number.  The client added a model number locator tool and a pop-up button that immediately pulled up the model number and keyword search field.  Satisfaction jumped seven points in just a few months while all future behaviors increased between 3-6 points.</p>
