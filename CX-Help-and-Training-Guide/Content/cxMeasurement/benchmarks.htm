        <h2><a name="WHAT"></a>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>A benchmark is a standardization that serves as a basis for evaluation or comparison.  In terms of ForeSee, Benchmarks are the mean scores/values for whatever the client wants to compare, such as their WOMI score to the average, their NPS score to the average, their SATISFACTION score to the industry average, etc.</p>
        <p>Benchmark comparisons range significantly in scope.  They can be as broad as the entire ForeSee Website Index, or as specific as an Apparel Browse benchmark which only includes clients who are classified as apparel retailers with a Browse Measure.  This increased level of specificity allows clients to compare themselves to a Benchmark category comprised of their closest competitors.</p>
        <h3>What is Benchmarked?</h3>
        <p>We benchmark the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Element Scores</li>
            <li>Satisfaction Scores</li>
            <li>Future Behavior Scores</li>
            <li>NPS</li>
            <li>WOMI</li>
            <li>Social Media Value</li>
            <li>True Conversion
                <p>For each of these client metrics, we offer peer comparisons broken down into numerous categories.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>We can think of our benchmark categories as increasing in granularity, from the Global benchmark, to categories by sector (public, private), by channel (web, mobile, store), by industry (retail, finance), by experience (browse, post-purchase, checkout), and even categories such as device (mobile, desktop, &amp; tablet), audience (B2B, B2C), product type (apparel, gifts), and country/language (UK, Canada, Germany).  Each increase in granularity allows for the client to compare themselves to a more accurate and closely related group of peers.</p>
        <div class="note">Industry-level benchmarks (finance, retail, etc.) without any other levels of granularity (finance browse, retail UK) will only include desktop data.  Industry-level mobile is its own benchmark (mobile finance).</div>
        <p>Benchmarks provide significant value to our clients by enabling them to better understand their performance in context with other companies and experiences—both within their industry as well others outside their industry that may be best in class.</p>

        <h2><a name="SEASONAL"></a>Seasonal/Holiday Benchmarks</h2>
        <p>Seasonal benchmarks provide deeper insights into the mindset of the customer during key seasonal/holiday times of the year.  Seasonal benchmarks allow clients to compare the seasonal/holiday experience against that of other companies from a satisfaction and behavioral/psychographic perspective.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We need at least five clients to create a seasonal/holiday benchmark.</li>
            <li>Clients must approve the use of 6-10 additional CQs in their survey.  These questions are only live for the specific seasonal/holiday time period.<ul><li>Internal research has shown that completion rates do not vary significantly as we add these survey questions.</li></ul></li>
            <li>There are no restrictions to which channels/measures the seasonal/holiday CQs can be added to.<ul><li>There is no limit to the number of measures/surveys a single client can have seasonal/holiday CQs on.<ul><li>A qualifier question is added to identify the respondents who were seasonal/holiday shopping.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
            <li>Seasonal/holiday specific analysis is only available to those clients that participate by adding the seasonal/holiday questions to their survey.</li>
            <li>In order to maintain comparability/benchmarking ability, question and answer wording should remain consistent.</li>
            <li>Our seasonal/holiday benchmarks are available for the US, Canada, and the UK.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="STORE"></a>Store Benchmarks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Store Browser measures do not offer benchmarks, only Store Purchaser measures.</li>
            <li>Clients with in-store Purchaser measures can get benchmarks for Elements, Satisfaction, and Future Behaviors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Store Benchmarks have a seven day offset due to the fact the survey is not required to be taken the same days as the in-store experience.  Store benchmarks are created on the 8th of each month for the month prior.</p>
        <h2><a name="MULTI-CH"></a>Multi-Channel Benchmarks</h2>
        <p>Our multi-channel benchmarks highlight performance differences across channels.  This allows company leaders to gain an understanding of the typical difference between channels.  With our benchmark quadrant view, those leaders can quickly see whether their company is delivering a leading, lagging, or unbalanced multi-channel experience.</p>
        <p>Multi-Channel Benchmark is available for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web/Mobile<ul><li>Mobile Optimized</li><li>Mobile App</li><li>Tablet Experience</li><li>Tablet App (NA yet due to low N count)</li></ul></li>

        <h3>Quadrant Graph for Multi-Channel benchmarks</h3>
        <p>There are two versions of Quadrant Graphs - One version for when a category has &gt;20 participants and another version for a category having &gt;5 but &lt;20 participants</p>

            <li>The red dot highlights your client score for the two channels, the yellow dot highlights the mean.</li>
            <li>Quadrants are using the benchmark score as a reference point, upper right corner indicates you are outperforming the benchmark and bottom left indicates you are under performing.</li>

        <h2><a name="INTERNAT"></a>International Benchmarks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Scores for each measure represent data from the last three complete months.</li>
            <li>Benchmarks for international segments are available for the following channels:  Web, Contact Center, Mobile.</li>
            <li>Only use benchmark scores for countries/languages/regions where there are at least five companies total.</li>
            <li>You can list the benchmark participants for any country/language/region where there are more than five companies.</li>
            <li>You can use the data sheets to combine countries, regions, languages, and other common latent scores.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="WOMI"></a>WOMI</h2>
        <p>WOMI is a ForeSee designed metric to address the business desire for a Word Of Mouth Indicator that is more reliable and accurate than NPS. WOMI eliminates a key assumption of NPS and calculates a Likely To Recommend score based on two questions, "Likelihood to recommend" vs. "Likelihood to discourage" (subtracting the latter percentage from the former) to provide a more stable metric on the same scale (-100 to 100) as NPS.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>WOMI questions in the survey can either be model questions or CQs.</li>
            <li>Must be on a 1-10 scale:<ul><li>1=Very Unlikely</li><li>10=Very Likely</li></ul></li>
            <li>The survey must have a Recommend question AND a Discourage question to calculate WOMI.</li>
            <li>WOMI cannot be about the website or Products/Services or anything other than company or brand.</li>
            <li>WOMI cannot have a ‘Don’t Know’ option.</li>
            <li>Questions cannot be next to each other on the survey.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="NPS"></a>NPS</h2>
        <p>NPS is a proxy measurement for true Satisfaction based on asking a question about likelihood to recommend a business and/or recommend a website. NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of those who score low on that score (0-6) from the percentage who answer high (9-10).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Can only be Model Questions for NPS, no CQs allowed.</li>
            <li>If the Latent has more than one question (which is very rare), you can not load it.</li>
            <li>1-10 scale question, the real NPS question is a 0-10 scale, but ours must be 1-10.</li>

        <h2><a name="TRUE"></a>True Conversion</h2>
        <p>True Conversion is used to describe the number of the respondents who said they were going to ‘purchase’ (or some other desired event) against how many of them actually did.</p>
        <p>There are four distinct types of True Conversion events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Purchase event - Customer completes a transaction.<ul><li>This is the most common type of True Conversion event.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Passive Event - Customer interacts with a specific piece of content, e.g., video, calculator, product configuration tool, etc.</li>
            <li>Active Event - Customer interacts with a specific piece of content that they must submit information to access, e.g., provide e-mail address to get a whitepaper, research document, etc.</li>
            <li>Direct Inquiry Event - Customer interacts with a specific piece of content that they must submit information to access and request follow up from the company, e.g., provide e-mail address to get a whitepaper, quote, etc. and receive a follow up from the company.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The measurement of True Conversion is accomplished by adding a CQ to the survey asking a respondent's primary purpose for visiting the site to determine the intent of the interaction.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The client can include any number of primary purposes, though around 5-10 is considered best practice.
            <p><img src="../Resources/Images/TrueConversionPrimaryPurpose.jpg" title="True Conversion Primary Purpose" alt="True Conversion Primary Purpose" /></p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>For each type of True Conversion event (Purchase, Passive, Active, and Direct Inquiry), the answer options for the Primary Purpose CQ need to be bundled into categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Purchase Event</b> - Each primary purpose answer option needs to fall under either Buy, Research, or Other.</li>
            <li><b>Passive Event</b> - Each primary purpose needs to fall under either Research, Education, or Other.</li>
            <li><b>Active Event</b> - Each primary purpose needs to fall under either Research, Education, Access Document, or Other.</li>
            <li><b>Direct Inquiry Event</b> - Each primary purpose needs to fall under either Research, Education, Access Document, or Other.</li>
            <li>The client can either categorize the answer options themselves, or DOT can provide the initial categorization and send the options back to the client for review.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on their response to the “Primary Purpose” CQ in the survey, respondents are placed into a table in our database.  We then use our persistent cookie to track if they made an actual purchase any time in the following seven days.  If they do, we match the Respondent ID in the cookie with the Respondent ID in the database.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the visitor clears their cache and cookies any time after taking our survey we are not be able to determine if they eventually made a purchase within the seven day window.</li>
            <li>The client must set up an event that our persistent cookie can recognize as a purchase event. The most common is a confirmation page URL, though they can use a JS variable or drop their own cookie at confirmation that our persistent cookie recognizes as a True Conversion  event.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The purchase event True Conversion is available as a  benchmark report within AAP and can be set up as a one-time report or a subscription.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Passive event, active event, and direct inquiry event True Conversions are not available as benchmarks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The True Conversion report icon still shows up on the AAP Reporting tab even if the client does not have True Conversion set up. However, a conversion event does not appear in the drop-down.</p>
        <p>The True Conversion report is available on the 15th of each month for the month prior.  This is due to the seven day offset for respondents to actually make a purchase, plus extra days after the 7th day of the month for manual work that needs to be done by IS to create the report.</p>
        <h2><a name="SOCIAL"></a>Social Media Value Benchmarks</h2>
        <p>This is a ForeSee designed metric for trending and benchmarking that indicates the significance of Social Media for driving digital customer traffic. By integrating with customer spend data, you can determine the value of the customers who are heavily engaged in social media in comparison with those less so.</p>
        <p>The Social Value CQ is worded similarly to the following screenshot.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/SocialValueCQ.png" title="Social Value CQ" alt="Social Value CQ" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All three rank questions must be added in order to count as Social Value questions.</li>
            <li>Answer choice changes to one set must be made to all three.</li>
            <li>For public sector social value questions, you may want to replace 'company' with 'organization/agency'</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The SMV external benchmark report includes the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Percentage/Number of respondents per social media influence category.</li>
            <li>Score for respondents per social media influence category.</li>
            <li>Overall Social Media Influence Score.</li>
            <li>Average Cart Value for True Conversion clients only.</li>
            <li>Can be distributed to clients IF they understand the report and what is presented.</li>
            <li>Foreign language surveys can also have social value questions. Please submit translation request to DOT.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="PUBLIC"></a>Public Sector Benchmarks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Public sector benchmarks include our government clients.</li>
            <li>Unlike our private sector benchmarks, which has a minimum of five unique clients to be able to build a benchmark, our public sector benchmarks require a minimum five unique measures.</li>
            <li>Public sector clients can get benchmarks for Elements, Satisfaction, and Future Behaviors.</li>
            <li>For public sector social value questions, you may want to replace 'company' with 'organization/agency'.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="CRM"></a>CRM Benchmarks</h2>
        <p>We do not currently have a Customer Relationship Measurement  benchmark.  There are two reasons for this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We have not gone live with a standardized model across at least five clients.</li>
            <li>The relationships being measured are different, leading to a false/inaccurate benchmark comparison.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="BENCHMAR"></a>Benchmarks Within Advanced Analytics Portal</h2>
        <p>External Benchmarks can be found under the Reporting tab of AAP, within the list of Comparison Reports.</p>
        <p>There are two types of benchmark reports, a General Benchmark Report and a Benchmark True Conversion Report.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For the General Benchmark Report, you can choose one of your elements, satisfaction, or future behaviors to benchmark.  If you want to get benchmarks on more than one of your elements, satisfaction, or future behaviors you must run multiple reports.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These benchmark reports can either be set up as a subscription or as a one time report.</p>
        <h2><a name="BENCHMAR2"></a>Benchmarks Within The Executive Portal</h2>
        <p>Data is displayed in the following interactive chart layouts which allow clients to drill-down into the data for specific information. These charts are organized by score, with the lowest score at the top. However, you can temporarily change the sequence by selecting the desired sort order from the Sort menu during their session. When you close the session, the sort order returns to the default sequence.</p>
        <h3>Tornado Chart</h3>
        <p>The client’s measure is the pivot point of this bar chart, where lower measures extend to the left and higher measures to the right. Each selected Benchmark Category is labeled and (when clicked) displays a summary of the category, details of how the client’s score compares, and a list of category members. This feature requires a minimum of five members. Categories with fewer members are noted in a pull-down section of the header (indicated by a downward pointing chevron).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have the ability to select either an element, satisfaction, or a future behavior as the score you want to benchmark against.</li>
            <li>You can choose which benchmark categories you want included in the chart.<ul><li>There is a limit of 15 benchmark categories that can be included within a single tornado chart.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Bullet Graph</h3>
        <p>This graph has the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Client’s score - Displays in the top margin with a reference line to visually compare with each category.</li>
            <li>Categories - Each category is positioned horizontally with a label and quantitative scale. This feature requires a minimum of five members. Categories with fewer members are noted in a pull-down section of the header (indicated by a downward pointing chevron).</li>
            <li>Mean - The average score for each category is displayed on the right of each category and represented in the scale.</li>
            <li>Maximum and Minimum Ratings - Each category's highest and lowest scores.</li>
            <li>Quartiles - The scale represents how category members scored in quartered (25%) segments. This feature requires a minimum of 20 members.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have the ability to select either an element, satisfaction, or a future behavior as the score you want to benchmark against.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can choose which benchmark categories you want included in the chart.<ul><li>There is a limit of 15 benchmark categories that can be included within a single bullet chart.</li></ul></li>

        <h2><a name="OTHER"></a>Other General Information</h2>
        <p>A client can get benchmarks for any part of the model: Elements, Satisfaction and Future Behaviors - provided they are using the ForeSee standard versions of these questions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When benchmarking elements and future behaviors, the clients included in each benchmark may vary based on which clients include those specific questions in their survey.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any measure that has less than 25 responses for a month is NOT included in the published benchmark calculations for that month.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The minimum requirement of 25 responses is specific to benchmarking latents. To benchmark NPS, a minimum of 150 responses in a month is required.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An initial benchmark categorization takes place for new measures once that measure has reached 300 responses.  If a new measure does not accumulate 300 responses in its first 13 months after going live, that measure is never added to any benchmark categories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The new measure needs to reach the 300th response by the 15th of the month.  If it reaches 300 after the 15th then it is added to the benchmark category(s) the following month.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are no limits to the amount of benchmark categories a single measure can belong to, though inclusion into a specific benchmark category must make sense.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A measure can be added to new/existing benchmark categories at any time in its lifecycle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Criteria used to create benchmark categories:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>NAICS - North American Industry Classification System</li>
            <li>Website survey types: Browse, Checkout Abandon, Post Purchase, Fulfillment, etc.</li>
            <li>Channel Types:  Web, Mobile, Contact Center, Stores, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How are benchmarks created?</h3>
        <p>A benchmark can be created when we have five or more like companies or experiences (i.e., authenticated website, cart abandonment, post-website visit, mobile app, chat), languages or countries. Having five or more grouped together inhibits the likelihood of deconstructing the benchmark to reveal individual scores.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each benchmark shows the high, low, and mean score along with the client’s score.</li>
            <li>A client score is never be shared with another client or externally.</li>
            <li>Only ForeSee clients have access to the ForeSee Benchmarks.</li>
            <li>Every ForeSee client participates in the indices.</li>
            <li>We are always looking to add more categories and welcome any ideas from employees on prospective new benchmarks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How often are benchmarks updated?</h3>
        <p>Benchmarks are updated on a monthly basis. In the middle of every month, the previous month's data is collected and distributed into the correct benchmarks. By the beginning of the next month you can see a client in their appropriate categories.</p>
