        <h2><a name="WHAT"></a>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>cxMeasure - Cart/Checkout Abandon measures the satisfaction with the shopping experience among visitors who placed items in the shopping cart but did not enter the checkout process, and visitors who entered the checkout process but did not complete a  purchase.</p>
        <p>Available in these channels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web</li>

        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>Retailers lose out on billions of dollars in sales every year due to cart and checkout abandonment.  With retailers already facing very small online conversion rates, it’s imperative to know exactly what issues are leading customers to not finish the purchase process.  cxMeasure - Cart/Checkout Abandon gives companies the ability to focus in on those consumers who abandoned the purchase process and determine exactly why they did not complete their purchase, giving them a significant advantage on their competitors.</p>
        <h2><a name="MODEL"></a>Model</h2>
        <p>Some variant of the Site Management - Authenticated Site model or a non-element model is recommended for both a Cart Abandon and Checkout Abandon measurement.  Below are the links for the Web or Table, Mobile, and App model templates.</p>

        <p><b>cxWeb/Mobile - Browse Measure</b> - Providing visitors with all the information they need, when they need it and how they need it is important in finalizing their purchase decision.  It’s not just issues with placing an item in the cart or with the checkout process that causes visitors to abandon before purchase. Any issue that comes up at any point in the visit may be enough to cause them to end their visit. Even if that issue happened prior to them placing the items in their cart or starting the checkout process.</p>
        <p><b>cxWeb/Mobile - Purchase</b> - The ability to compare those that finished the purchase process against those that abandoned somewhere before completion is a useful tool to have as it adds another layer of understanding to the entire website experience.</p>
        <h2><a name="GENERAL"></a>General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No prerequisites or dependencies, may be a leading measure.</li>
            <li>For either Cart Abandon or Checkout Abandon measures, we must be able to identify that something has been added to the basket/cart or that the checkout process has begun.<ul><li>If we need to check if somebody has added something to their basket, it most likely requires the client to provide an identifier for us (JS variable or cookie).</li><li>If we are trying to identify the checkout process, most of the time we will use the URL pattern provided by the client.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Triggering Mechanisms Available:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Trigger Option #1</u>: Present the invitation to the Browse survey. Once we see someone has entered the checkout/basket, or added an item in their cart, our code uses logic to move them from a Browse to the Abandon survey.<ul><li>We cannot use this method if True Conversion is used with the Browse survey due to the fact we have to lock the visitor into the Browse measure since True Conversion is only applicable to Browse measures.</li></ul></li>
            <li><u>Trigger Option #2</u>: Present the invitation after we see that an item is in the cart, or on the first page of the checkout flow.</li>
            <li><u>Trigger Option #3</u>: Use a "click event" to launch our tracker window, skipping the invitation. On click of a button, like “add to cart” or “proceed to checkout”, the tracker window is set to launch x% of the time.<ul><li>Some browsers do not allow the tracker window to focus to the background automatically. In this case, the tracker presents on top of the browsing window.</li></ul></li>
