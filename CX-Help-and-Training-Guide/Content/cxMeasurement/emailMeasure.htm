        <h2><a name="WHAT"></a>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>cxMeasure for Email is a single, dedicated measurement of customer facing content delivered via an email interface.</p>
        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>Most companies use traditional metrics like open rates, bounce backs, and click through rates to evaluate the health of their e-newsletter and account management emails.  What is missing is an assessment of customer satisfaction with email elements and how these elements affect users' future behaviors.</p>
        <h2><a name="TARGET"></a>Target Audience</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Marketing Communications Teams</li>
            <li>Contact Center Teams</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="ACTIONAB"></a>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <p>A Government client was interested in evaluating the effectiveness of the email conversion process, facilitating updates and getting constituents to key information of interest on the website.  They found that health researchers and analysts to consistently be the lowest scoring subscriber group. One-third of the health researchers and analysts reported that the body of the email did not include enough information. This group also links to their expected information less often than other subscribers. ForeSee suggested that the client tailor the email message and amount of content to the recipient.  Certain user groups including health researchers/analyst, consumers and nurses frequently wanted more information.  Physicians/physician assistants were the group where the amount of information was most on target.</p>
        <p>A government client found that approximately one in four subscribers were using mobile devices to read their email. Through a ForeSee Email Measure, data showed that these mobile users were having an inferior experience compared to desktop users.  Look and Feel was one of the lowest scoring elements in this subscriber segment.  Subscriber feedback suggested improving the email layout to be more mobile-friendly.  Once the client initiated these changes, they quickly saw satisfaction and future behaviors reach near-desktop levels</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Questions about the email content, such as:<ul><li>Is there adequate info in the subject line?</li><li>Is there adequate info in the email body?</li><li>Is the email an appropriate length?</li><li>Is the content of the email relevant to you?</li></ul></li>
            <li>Is the frequency of the emails appropriate?</li>
            <li>How long have you been a subscriber of [client’s] emails?</li>
            <li>How often do you click on the links within [client’s] emails?</li>
