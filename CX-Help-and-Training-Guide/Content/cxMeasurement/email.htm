        <ul>
            <li>Time between email collection and invitation delivery is configurable:<ul><li>Purchase - Typically, email invitation goes out immediately.</li><li>Post-Visit - Typically, email invitation goes out seven days or 14 days after visit (depends on the length of the shopping funnel - i.e., we want to allow the respondent enough time to conduct follow-up activities. Car Shopping = longer funnel, Electronics = shorter funnel).</li><li>All Other Measures = Timeline to be discussed during implementation. Dependent on who is sending and how frequently client can accommodate. Ideally, we would send the invitation as close to the interaction being evaluated as possible.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Number of reminder emails<ul><li>Number of reminders is typically two, sent at three days after original invitation and seven days after original invitation.</li></ul></li>
            <li>The standard survey expiration time frame is seven days after the final reminder is sent out.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="FORESEE6"></a>ForeSee Sends Email Invite: ForeSee Capabilities</h2>
        <h3>ForeSee can do the following:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Deduping:</b> ForeSee can accommodate deduplicating the email list against other email lists that the client has sent previously and merging lists to a single email list. Also to manage repeat days process (e.g., don’t invite within X number of days).</li>
            <li><b>Opt-Out Process:</b> ForeSee maintains a client-specific list of email recipients that have requested not to be contacted by ForeSee again for this client’s surveys. ForeSee can NOT manage opt-out processes for the client or within the client’s CRM system. An opt-out link is typically included at the bottom of the ForeSee sponsored email invitation. We can NOT provide a list of respondents who have opted-out back to the client.</li>
            <li><b>Survey Link Expiration:</b> See <a href="#FORESEE" title="Click to view this section." alt="Click to view this section.">Fielding Guidelines</a> section.</li>
            <li><b>Response Activity Tracking:</b> ForeSee captures the following parameters and can create a waterfall report on them if needed (through a JIRA request to IS).  The report can be set up to run at a frequency of the client’s choice, though weekly is default.
                <ul><li>Number of rows in the email address file</li><li>Number of emails successfully sent out</li><li>Number of emails failed to send</li><li>Number of email invitations opened</li><li>Number of surveys displayed (e.g., the URL within the email was clicked on)</li><li>Number of surveys submitted</li></ul></li>
            <li><b>Random Selection Within a Single List:</b> We can programmatically select every Nth row in a file to allow for random sampling across that file. We would provide guidance on what the "Nth" should be based on the volume of available emails within a file and the desired N Count.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="FORESEE5"></a>ForeSee Sends Email Invite: Requirements For Passing Data To ForeSee</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The file must have column headers and cannot contain spaces.<ul><li>Order_ID instead of Order ID</li></ul></li>

            <li>One row per respondent.</li>
            <li>ForeSee respondent ID required as a data point in each row.</li>

ForeSee will set up a SFTP site specific to the client.</li><li>The file can include additional variables that can be appended to the survey URL to pass as CPPs.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>ForeSee emails have the capability to accommodate dynamic text.<ul><li>Please be sure to highlight the areas in the email text that are dynamically populated.</li><li>Each item that presents itself dynamically must be in a separate column in the email file that is sent to ForeSee.</li><li>The client must communicate which columns in the file fill in what areas of the email text.</li><li>If the survey is translated into another language, then the dynamic text needs to be translated (if applicable) before sending the email file to ForeSee.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="CLIENT"></a>Client Sends Email Invite: General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If the client answers yes to ANY of the questions below, ForeSee MUST load their email file PRIOR to them sending the email:<ul><li>Do you want the link to expire?</li><li>Do you care if the link can be submitted multiple times?</li><li>Do you have a lot of parameters (EPPs) you want to append?</li></ul></li>
            <li>Client must send a sample file of email addresses and EPPs (sample below):<ul><li>The file can be saved as either Comma Separated Values (CSV) or Tab Delimited (.txt).</li><li>The sample file and future files must be sent to a ForeSee SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).</li></ul></li>

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>ForeSee must have the name(s) and contact information of who is responsible for sending the emails on the client side, so we can set up a process to notify them when we have successfully loaded their files and they are safe to send out their emails.</li>
            <li>The survey link will not expire if the client sends the email.</li>
            <li>Survey submission is unlimited, we cannot stop a respondent from submitting multiple surveys from the same link.</li>
            <li>Additional CPPs beyond the default captured CPPs are limited by the URL API length.</li>
