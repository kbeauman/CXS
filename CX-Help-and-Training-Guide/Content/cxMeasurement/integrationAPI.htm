        <h2><a name="WHAT"></a>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>cxIntegrate - API is a unidirectional integration at the survey respondent level.  This integration product deals specifically with <b>our</b> API , not the specific Omniture API or Google Analytics/Universal Analytics API solution. Our Public API allows clients to programmatically access their ForeSee data via a secure, direct connection to the Data Warehouse. It provides access to both respondent and aggregate level metrics</p>
        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>By using our API, clients are able to pull our Voice Of Customer data into their internal data bases for strategic purposes.  Also, by using our API, clients get a more automated transfer of data in comparison to using a more manual SFTP.</p>
        <h2><a name="GENERAL"></a>General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Must purchase Executive Portal to gain access to the API. Exceptions require Sales Leadership/Sales Engineering approval.</li>
            <li>This is a self-service solution - clients should consult with their internal technology teams familiar with API and direct them to the ForeSee Developer Portal for guidance: <a href="http://developer.foresee.com/docs-articles/public-api/" target="_blank" title="Click to view this web site." alt="Click to view this web site.">http://developer.foresee.com/docs-articles/public-api/</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="SETUP"></a>Setup Process</h2>
        <p>Step 1:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Determine if the client is already an Executive Portal subscriber. There is a prerequisite that the client have EP to use API.<ul><li>If the client does not use EP, notify the Account Manager.</li><li>If the client is an EP user, point them to the Public API section of the ForeSee Developer Portal.  This should answer the majority of questions they may have about the API.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Step 2:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must provide the client with access to the API.<ul><li>To set up authorization, you must submit a Delivery Support Ticket requesting a Portal user account be created for public API access and a key/secret for authentication to the API that you then give to the client so they can get started.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is a self-service solution - once these two steps have been completed, it is up to the client and their technical teams familiar with API and the internal databases to program the datafeed processes.</p>
