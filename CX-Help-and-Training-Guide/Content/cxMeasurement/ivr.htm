        <h2><a name="WHAT"></a>What Is It?</h2>
        <p>An IVR/IVA survey is a pre-recorded automated survey in which the customer responds to questions either by voice (IVA) or by typing numerical responses using the telephone keypad (IVR).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IVR = Interactive Voice Response</li>
            <li>IVA = Intelligent Voice Automation</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Two Sides Of IVR/IVA</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Deployment<ul><li>How we deploy IVR/IVA to the customer and how they are able to hear it:<ul><li>IVR - Human recorded speech.</li><li>IVA - Computer recorded speech.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
            <li>Capture<ul><li>How the respondent is able to respond:<ul><li>IVR - Keypad capture.</li><li>IVA - Voice recognition capture (not currently offered - still testing, requires Sales Engineering approval).</li></ul></li></ul></li>

        <h2><a name="WHICH"></a>Which Products Use It?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="contactCenter.htm" title="Click to view this Product Guide topic." alt="Click to view this Product Guide topic.">Contact Center</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contact Centers use IVR to deploy surveys after the customer has finished interacting with the customer service representative.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><a href="store.htm" title="Click to view this Product Guide topic." alt="Click to view this Product Guide topic.">Store</a>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stores use IVR to deploy surveys from POS receipts.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>All other measure types require Sales Engineering approval.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="TYPES"></a>Types Of IVR/IVA Deployments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Inbound</b> - Customer calls to take the survey (Store Purchaser only).</li>
            <li><b>Call Transfer</b> - Customers are invited to take the survey at the start of a support call and transferred to the prerecorded survey (Contact Center measures).</li>
            <li><b>Dial-Back IVR</b> - A list of customer phone numbers who have contacted the call center are automatically dialed and when the call is accepted the IVR survey begins. (Alternative method - requires Sales Engineering approval).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="IVR"></a>IVR Integration</h2>
        <p><b>IVR Integration</b> - Annual IVR setup/integration fee which includes programming, survey voice recordings from defined voice talent list, hosting, and data collection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer is required to assist IVR partner (e.g., Verascape or SmartAction) in the implementation and testing process.</li>
            <li>Client can also choose from an automated Text To Speach (TTS) voice instead of voice talent. Voice talent is an additional charge while TTS is not.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="SURVEY"></a>Survey Minutes</h2>
        <p><b>Survey Minutes</b> - Typically, invoice up front based on 80% of the annual estimated minutes; invoice final amount at end of year to true up estimates.  Consult with Legal/Finance on actual terms.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Minutes consumed includes the total time that any respondent is in the survey portion of the capture including open-end comments.</li>
            <li>IVR partner only delivers fully completed surveys, unless survey has 16 or more question - in which case partially completed surveys are included.<ul><li>For surveys with 16 or more questions, all MQs are required (up to 12), and all CQs are optional.</li><li>Partials require a separate price per minute fee - to be determined whether to expose in the contract.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Sales Engineering can facilitate a cost estimate after initial call volumes are determined.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="QUESTION"></a>QUESTION CHANGES</h2>
        <p><b>Question Changes</b> - Alteration and implementation of additional questions or wording changes as required:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Customer/Foresee to provide question script.</li>
            <li>Utilize existing voice talent options.</li>
            <li>Modifications to the survey after script approval is given and voice recording is completed requires a per question change fee ($500).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="TRANSCRI"></a>Transcriptions</h2>
        <p><b>Transcriptions</b> - Transcription of open-ended comments into text and loading into Foresee portal:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes hosting of WAV file for indefinite amount of time.</li>
            <li>May be able to transcribe Non-English audio - if using Smart Action. Requires additional costs.</li>
            <li>Manual transcription - Human based ~98% accurate, available 2-5 days after survey completion, timing dependent on partner used.</li>
            <li>Computer transcription - 30% accurate, available with quicker turnaround. Not best practice - requires Sales Engineering approval.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="FUNCTION"></a>Functional (Non-Model) Measure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Functional (non-model) IVR surveys are available for Contact Center measures only (not for Store measures) at this time.</li>
            <li>5-7 CQs is considered best practice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="IVR2"></a>IVR Alerting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Alerting is available with Store, Contact Center, and Functional if the client uses Smart Action as the IVR vendor.<ul><li><b>Requires Sales Engineering approval</b></li></ul></li>
            <li>A standard IVR alert configuration includes up to three alert criteria and a single distribution list for each alert criteria.</li>
            <li>If multiple parties are to receive alerts, we prefer the client provide a single "group distribution list" for each alert trigger and the client modify inclusion/exclusion within that group on the client side.</li>
            <li>If the client has a PSTN telephony system, then the only variable that can be passed to SmartAction and included in the alert is the Caller ANI (caller's phone number). All other information which the client wants regarding the specific caller/respondent must be matched up on their end using the Caller ANI.</li>
            <li>If the client has Web Service capability within their telephony system, and can pass the desired variables to SmartAction with the caller, then some additional implementation work is needed. However, SmartAction is able to include those variables within the email alert.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="GENERAL"></a>General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Preferred maximum survey length be 12 questions.</li>
            <li>We now have the capability to include more than one open-end response into a single IVR survey.</li>
            <li>IVR has only one model question per element and responses are only on a 1-9 scale, 0 as Don’t Know for element questions only.</li>
            <li>IVR/IVA models are not partitioned.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="CONTACT"></a>Contact Center Specific Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of this option assumes the customer will manage the call prompting/invitation process within their IVR system - typically through a vector prompt or telephony switch.<div class="example">ForeSee cannot manage quota sampling by call type.</div></li>
            <li>Requires that agent be able to hang up or transfer call manually. Alternatives require Sales Engineering approval.</li>
            <li>Customer must be able to support VDN scripting or vector routing to direct call to IVR survey application.</li>
            <li>Must be able to pass us agent ID through one of the following options:<ul><li>PSTN = We can capture caller ID (or client can replace that field with Agent ID) only. If Caller ID, client must be able to match on that ID and append Agent ID as part of EXDL Integration process.</li><li>SIP = We can capture much more data with call transfer. This requires unique implementation and additional costs per client.</li><li>MPLS = We can capture much more data with call transfer. Requires unique implementation and additional costs per client.  Much more expensive to implement and is not recommended.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="STORE"></a>Store Specific Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Client prints both the URL and TFN on the receipt.</li>
            <li>Adjustments may be needed to control sample sizes/costs once live (i.e., reduction in the number of receipts including IVR options).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="DEPLOYME"></a>DEPLOYMENT STATISTICS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>IVR Acceptance rates</b> - 20-60% (Vary significantly based on audience being targeted and length/type of call).</li>
            <li><b>IVR Completion rates</b> - 85-95%</li>
