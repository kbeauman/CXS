        <p><b>Shareable Link</b> - The recipient can view the dashboard as a web page. However, the data does not change from the moment you click the Share icon.</p>
        <p><b>PDF Download</b> -  The recipient can save the dashboard as a PDF document. Each dashboard tile is placed on a separate page with all the metadata displayed, i.e., the header is expanded. However, drill-down data is not available in a PDF.</p>

        <h3>Customization of the Dashboard for sharing purposes</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Colors of widgets cannot be customized.</li>
            <li>Tiles are comprised of customizable graphics, such as charts, grids, and Open Ends. The type of data displayed in a given tile originates from one of the following sources:<ul><li>Scores - A Score is a numeric value, ranging from zero to one hundred, which represents a specific measure.</li><li>Benchmarks - Benchmarks are scores derived from other ForeSee clients for the purpose of comparison.</li><li>Open Ends - Open ends is a category of responses comprised of narratives from respondents.</li></ul></li>
