        <h2><a name="WHAT"></a>What Is It?</h2>
        <h3>Store Purchaser</h3>
        <p>Measures satisfaction with the store experience among purchasers only, typically via survey invitations on a printed receipt, e-receipt, or email, and can be incentivized (sweepstakes, coupon). Full model. Includes hierarchy management/reporting.</p>
        <h3>Store Feedback</h3>
        <p>Measures satisfaction with the Store experience among Non-Purchasers, but can include Purchasers if client would like. Typically deployed via store signage. Non-Element Model.  Cannot be incentivized.  Does not have hierarchy management/reporting.</p>
        <h3>Store Browser</h3>
        <p>Measures satisfaction with the store experience among non-purchasers, but can include purchasers if the client would like.  Full model. Typically deployed via store signage. Can be incentivized (sweepstakes, coupon).  Includes hierarchy management/reporting.</p>
        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>Shoppers have more control over where they spend their dollars than ever before. Prices, product reviews, and opinions are more accessible than ever via the web, mobile, and social media. Because of this, It’s critical that clients understand how the shoppers’ experience in the store impacts overall revenue, comparable store sales, and customer loyalty. Limited resources make it crucial that investments are prioritized right so you can stay current with shopper trends and preferences.</p>
        <p>ForeSee continuously measures the shoppers’ view of their experience in your store through the lens of satisfaction. Satisfaction, when measured using this proven methodology, is predictive of future financial performance through future behaviors such as likelihood to return to the store and likelihood to recommend, while continuous measurement allows you to monitor the pulse of your shoppers throughout the year.</p>
        <h2><a name="TARGET"></a>Target Audience</h2>
        <h3>Target Selling Audience</h3>
        <p><b>Leaders of Customer Experience/Insights/Marketing</b>
        </p>
        <p>Corporate management requires insights into the performance of the chain overall, and the ability to prioritize initiatives and opportunities for improvement, including strategic aspects of the brand such as product and price.</p>
        <p><b>Store Operations and Field Management</b>
        </p>
        <p>The store operations organization requires actionable data down to the store level to understand where to focus associate attention and efforts to improve same store sales.</p>
        <h3>Key Stakeholders/Users</h3>
        <p><b>Store Managers</b>
        </p>
        <p>While we don't sell Store Measures directly to store managers, they can still find data useful because store managers live in the store. They worry about hitting monthly sales targets and they want to know each week what they can do to coach their staff  to drive up per transaction sales. They want to know what they can control, in their location, that makes customers come back to them.</p>
        <h2><a name="ACTIONAB"></a>Actionable Insights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Retail industry client found that 25% of customers were not purchasing all they intended.  The analysis revealed that associates were not offering special orders for out-of-stock products.  These customer order value were $30 less per transaction, and they would end up buying at a competitor.  During the time period analyzed it was a multi-million dollar loss.</li>
            <li>Retail industry client found that 75% of web visitors intended to purchase in store, and that close to 10% ended buying from a competitor based on a poor store experience.  This drove them to begin continuous measurement in store including store execution steps.</li>
            <li>Product Retail industry client discovered 1/3 of customers had low Product Selection scores leading to a 20 point differential in Overall Satisfaction.  ForeSee discovered this was due to stock-outs on desired product.  Justified investment in tablet technology to empower associates to special order on the spot.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Deployment Intricacies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For Standard/Best Practice Store Purchaser deployment options, POS receipt and eReceipt can be used concurrently without extra cost.</li>
            <li>IVR can be used concurrently with both POS receipt and eReceipt (Standard IVR costs apply).  IVR is counted as a separate survey and data remains separate within the portal.</li>
            <li>For Store Purchaser, we can make sure there are no duplicate submissions regardless of the number of deployment types used due to a unique receipt code.</li>
            <li>For Store Browser and Feedback, multiple deployment types can be used (standard IVR costs apply).  We have limited control for duplicate submissions when using multiple submission types for Browser and Feedback.</li>
            <li>Client must provide Bit.ly URL and QR code.  Client or ForeSee can send SMS text back, extra costs apply if ForeSee sends text back.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="INCLUDED"></a>Included, Add-on, and Complementary Products &amp; Measures</h2>
        <p><b>Products Included In Base Contract</b> - Technologies, capabilities, and functionalities that should be considered baseline for a Store Measure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advanced Analytics Portal (some government clients have exception)</li>
            <li>Ad-Hoc</li>
            <li>Comment Cluster</li>
            <li>Store Benchmarks</li>
            <li>WOMI and NPS (if applicable to client)</li>
            <li>4 SIRs included but can be reduced to save costs (Purchaser only)</li>
            <li>Transactional Data Append (Purchaser Only)</li>

        <p><b>Deliverables and Add-Ons</b> - A capability, technology, or functionality separately priced that enhances a Store measure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Filtered Impacts</li>
            <li>Integration - Respondent or Corporate Level</li>
            <li><a href="sentimentAnalytics.htm" title="Click to view this Product Guide topic." alt="Click to view this Product Guide topic.">Sentiment Analytics</a>

            <li>Deliverables (e.g., SIRs, Scorecards)</li>
            <li>IVR deployment (additional cost)</li>
            <li>Additional locations</li>
            <li>Incentive management (Purchaser and Browser only)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Complementary Products/Measures</b> - Products/measures that, when paired with a Store measure, have been shown to enhance the breadth, width, and scope of the solution ForeSee offers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>cxFulfillment</b> - Not every customer who goes to a store is going there to buy or will leave with what they intended to buy.  Sometimes the store doesn’t have their item in stock and they end up ordering it for delivery or pick-up; sometimes the order has already been placed in a different channel.  Fulfillment provides a seamless transition between the complicated relationship stores play in getting the product into the hands of the consumer.</li>
            <li><b>cxWeb / Mobile - Browse, <a href="purchase.htm" title="Click to view this Product Guide topic." alt="Click to view this Product Guide topic.">Purchase</a>, Abandon</b> - Adding a digital  measure can help define the customer journey.  Maybe the customer browsed online to get information on the product and intended to purchase in the Store channel all along.  Maybe they were unable to finish the checkout process online and finished in the store channel.</li>
            <li><b><a href="contactCenter.htm" title="Click to view this Product Guide topic." alt="Click to view this Product Guide topic.">Contact Center</a></b> - Both Contact Centers and Stores are channels for purchasing behaviors, and as such provide a sample of people making a conversion and rating the experience of doing so.  Being able to measure both in the same way is a step in creating a multi-channel view of the customer.</li>
            <li><b><a href="employee.htm" title="Click to view this Product Guide topic." alt="Click to view this Product Guide topic.">Employee</a></b> - It’s safe to say that when elements of the Store model include Associate Engagement and Service keeping a pulse of your employees and understanding their motivations and concerns is important.  Because ESat drives CSat, it’s imperative to be aware of opportunities for increased employee satisfaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="STORE"></a>Store Purchaser/Browser General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>There is usually a specific open window of time when a person can take a survey (offset/lag). The typical offset is within seven days of purchase (day of purchase counts as day one).</li>
            <li>For IVR, customer must have base store measure in place.</li>
            <li>IVR data remains separate from Non-IVR data.</li>
            <li>Clients with &gt;2000 stores need to be approved by Sales Engineering before selling.</li>
            <li>Base contract includes one brand - additional brands/languages require Store Segment. Store Segments require use of the same hierarchy.</li>
            <li>Allows for additional blocks of stores to be added to hierarchy and store reporting.  Additional stores sold in blocks of 100.</li>
            <li>There is a price break on store blocks at the 5000+ mark.</li>
            <li>Transactional data (Store Purchaser and Store IVR) is only for complete surveys collected (i.e., not partial completes or all client transactional data).</li>
            <li>For a typical Store Purchaser or Store Browser measure, implementation can be achieved in 6-8 weeks as long as client is able to meet milestones within the timeline.</li>
            <li>Adding brands, languages, CQs, or another measure increases implementation time.</li>
            <li>Client is responsible for design, printing, and displaying of signage (Browser/Feedback).</li>
            <li>If the client decides to move away from the hierarchy, this measure should be moved out of the store channel and page flows should be disabled which would eliminate all fraud protection.<ul><li>This would require a break in the model as the data which is currently stored in the store database at the store level would now need to be stored in the main database which stores data at the survey level.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Add-On Store Measures can be purchased at a lower price. Hierarchy must be the same.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="STORE2"></a>Store Purchaser/Browser Incentivization Information</h2>
        <h3>Sweepstakes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tech has the ability to set a persistent cookie which would take the respondent to the sweepstakes page if they tried to take the survey again (Browser only).<ul><li>This cookie only works if the IP address is the same, as there is a possibility that some respondents could take the survey multiple times, but it would be considerably reduced.</li></ul></li>
            <li>The incentive management company that we work with removes duplicate names before any prize drawing.</li>
            <li>ForeSee has the ability to manage the client’s sweepstakes.  We charge an incentive management fee, which includes the part IS handles
:        <p><b>ForeSee Incentive Management assumes:</b></p><ul><li>Monthly drawing</li><li>One gift card awarded per drawing</li><li>Prize value does not exceed $500 U.S. Dollars</li><li>US/UK residents only</li></ul><p><b>ForeSee Incentive Management includes:</b></p><ul><li>Winner selection and notification</li><li>Winner compliance and verification (tax forms, affidavits, etc.)</li><li>Rules development</li><li>Bonding and registration as required</li></ul><p><b>All other assumptions and inclusions would be considered custom</b></p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Process For Adding/Removing Incentives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>New Store implementation with a <u>new incentive</u> goes through Launch.</li>
            <li>Current Store implementation with <u>renewing incentive</u> goes through Chris Baisden IF it is a ForeSee (PrizeLogic) managed incentive. Once Chris gets the updated rules, the analyst/CM needs to put in a Portal Support ticket in JIRA including the rules two weeks prior to the current rules expiring. <div class="note">It is up to CS to know if the rules need to be translated before putting in the Portal Support ticket.</div></li>
            <li>If client is managing sweepstakes, CS needs to put in a Portal Support ticket with all relevant translations two weeks prior to the current rules expiring.  Client decides if rules expire.</li>
            <li>Current Store implementation adding a <u>new sweepstakes</u> should go through Launch BUT that depends on their bandwidth. The reason this should go through Launch is additional pages have to be developed and the page flow path changes when adding on a sweepstakes. IF Launch cannot handle it, then it is up to the analyst to put all relevant information into Tech via Portal Support in JIRA.</li>
            <li>If a client wants to remove a sweepstakes, CS must put in a Portal Support ticket as soon as possible (at least two weeks prior to the current rules expiring) as Tech has to remove certain pages from the page flow path.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Coupon</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The coupon page or email are both configurable, but there are limitations to the coupon code that we generate.<ul><li>We use an algorithm to randomly create a coupon code. We do not have the ability to choose from a list of predefined codes or host a static code which would have to be updated frequently.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Tech has created a STYP that allows a respondent to enter their email address and have a coupon emailed to that email address.<ul><li>Page checks to see if the email address has already received coupon email within a given period of time (which is configurable).</li><li>Store Purchaser - system validates if a different transaction number was used, could potentially send out another coupon.</li><li>If the client chooses this option, they cannot have any other STYP page enabled.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="STORE3"></a>Store Purchaser/Browser Fraud Deterrents</h2>
        <p>ForeSee can provide methods to evaluate and prevent gaming through several means. Fraud deterrents can be automated as well as just provided in a monthly fraud report that would be used for monitoring purposes only. Deterrents include the following security methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CAPTCHA security at the point of entry to reduce/eliminate machine based or automated script based entry.</li>
            <li>Survey Time Less than 90 second (is configurable) - If a respondent takes less than 90 seconds to complete their survey, their responses are not loaded in the portal. Updates to the survey completion time threshold can be accommodated on a quarterly basis if needed.</li>
            <li>Same UID (cookie) within 48 hours - Upon accessing the store landing page, a cookie is dropped on the respondent’s system. Each time the respondent accesses the landing page, a check for the cookie is performed and if the timestamp on this cookie falls within 48 hours, the respondent is allowed to take the survey, but their results are not loaded into the AAP. Updates to the time period threshold can be accommodated on a quarterly basis if needed.</li>
            <li>Validation of the cashier ID beyond the standard solution, building in logic which would not accept the same # (77777) or sequential patterns (12345) - dependent on these patterns NOT being possible within the a valid code.</li>
            <li>Creation of a new algorithm that would be nearly impossible to break. Client would need to implement the algorithm into their POS System once provided.</li>
            <li>Same IP Address within 48 hours - Upon accessing the store landing page, a check is performed to identify whether the respondent’s IP Address matches any IP addresses already collected within the last 48 hours. If a match is made, a flag is added to the respondent to identify them as duplicate IP address respondent. The respondent is allowed to take the survey and their results are loaded to the portal along with the duplicate IP address flag. If duplicate IP addresses are occurring too often, we can re-evaluate whether the data should or should not be loaded into the portal.</li>
            <li>Unique, non-repeatable survey URL combinations which eliminate bookmarking or automated repeat entry.</li>
            <li>ForeSee has the ability to send a monthly report of “flagged” respondents identified by the fraud prevention measures – providing a method for assessing and adjusting fraud parameters where needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="STORE4"></a>Store Purchaser/Browser Hierarchy Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We can only support a 1-to-1 relationship within the hierarchy.<div class="example">One store rolls up to one district rolls up to one region, etc.</div></li>
            <li>We can only support eight hierarchy levels and seven attributes.</li>
            <li>Once a store is part of the hierarchy, it will always be part of the hierarchy.  Stores are not removed from the hierarchy once they have been added.  If a store closes and you do not want to see it included as part of its previous hierarchy within the reporting, please work with your CX Analyst to create and move it into appropriate ‘closed’ hierarchy levels (Ex. District 9999).  A closed hierarchy report still runs but can be disregarded.</li>
            <li>In the event a change occurs in the hierarchical structure, for example, Store 123 moves from District A to District B, all historical data is reported as if Store 123 was always in District B.</li>
            <li>If a store closes, the store ID should not be reused for a future or new store.  If a store ID is re-used, all of the historic data previously collected under that ID remains attached to it.</li>
            <li>A best practice is to include the store ID as the lead-in on the store name.  This helps identify stores in the portal as the _NAME field is what is used for the label. <div class="example">Store Name = <b>0001-ForeSee East instead of ForeSee East.</b></div></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="STORE5"></a>STORE FEEDBACK GENERAL INFO</h2>
