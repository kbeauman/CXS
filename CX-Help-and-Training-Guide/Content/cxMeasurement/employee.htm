        <h2><a name="WHAT"></a>What Is It?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Employee Experience Measurement is a single dedicated measurement of an organization’s employees, at both corporate level or store associate/agent level.</li>
            <li>Available for both large (250 - 50,000 employees) and small businesses (less than 250 employees).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="WHY"></a>Why Use It?</h2>
        <p>It costs a business about one-fifth of a worker’s salary to replace that worker.  A business can improve their employee engagement and reduce their employee turnover by using ForeSee’s Employee Experience Measurement to provide insights into such areas as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What experiences matter?</li>
            <li>What does our workforce value?</li>
            <li>What employee initiatives should we plan for next year?</li>
            <li>Is our current thinking on improving employee engagement on track?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="TARGET"></a>Target Audience</h2>
        <h3>Economic Stakeholders Targeting:</h3>
        <h4>Human Resources Leaders (e.g., VP/Director HR)</h4>
        <p>Among the many responsibilities, HR teams must ensure that employee benefits, compensation, training, and work tools are meaningful and contribute to employee engagement in the workplace. The right HR programs can create a rewarding experience within a company and as a result reduce unnecessary turn-over and absenteeism.</p>
        <h4>Business Owners (Small Business Option)</h4>
        <p>For small businesses (less than 250 employees), there may not be anybody in HR who can make the decision to purchase our Employee Experience solution.  In this case, the decision maker is probably the business owner.  For small businesses, the ability to absorb employee issues is greatly reduced due to the decrease in scale, so the business owner needs to be aware of their employee’s engagement.  The owner also has many other job duties, so having somebody to partner with to help understand the pulse of their employees is crucial as it allows the owner to focus on the day to day operations of the company.</p>
        <h2><a name="COMMON"></a>Common CQs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Improvement: In which of the following areas does the company need to improve? (select all that apply)</li>
            <li>Inclusion: Do you feel you are part of a team when you come to work?</li>
            <li>Leadership: Do you feel confident in the direction of the company as provided by our executive leadership?</li>
            <li>Tenure: How long have you been employed with this company?</li>
            <li>Questions about/rating benefits, performance reviews, and/or training.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Standard base measure Includes up to 50,000 employees.</li>
            <li>Includes setup and email/token distribution (single fielding period).</li>
            <li>Clients with less than 100,000 employees require Sales Engineering approval.</li>
            <li>Allows for additional blocks of 10,000 employees to be added to hierarchy and reporting.</li>
            <li>Data is collected through a survey designed for response via web or mobile channels.</li>
            <li>Additional deployments of the survey can be purchased and include the additional fielding period as well as an additional EIR.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To follow-up on ESAT and the ability to pass external parameters - the answer is - for any other client (besides ourselves) this can be accommodated. But, we should caution clients to be selective around the information passing, as it could dilute the "anonymity" of the results. We recommend clients are honest with their employees about what information is passed along with the results and how it is used. If clients are hesitant to do this, then they should ask for this information as CQs and not pass it as metrics - allowing respondents to pick and choose what information they would like to provide.</p>
