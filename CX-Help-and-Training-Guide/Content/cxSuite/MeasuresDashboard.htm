You can access the <span class="wintitle">Measure Dashboard</span> by clicking on the desired measure on the <a href="cx360.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">CX 360 Dashboard</a>, or by clicking <span class="uicontrol">Surveys</span> in the <a href="using.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Top Navigation Bar</a> and selecting the measure from the menu.</p>
        <p>Below the <span class="wintitle">Top Navigation Bar</span> is a secondary toolbar containing a menu of measures, a <a href="../CaseMgmt/datePicker.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">date picker</a>, a menu of filters, and export commands.  You can use this secondary toolbar to navigate to all your surveys, segment the data based on date intervals or filtered groups (like first time visitors), and you can export the displayed data into a PowerPoint presentation for disseminating information throughout your organization. </p>

        <p> This dashboard displays a handful of default cards that tell you a.) How am I doing, How do I compare to myself and is the change significant or not, how do I compare to others (Gauge), b.) How am I performing over time (Trendview), c.) What do I need to fix and why does it matter (Score Summary Card), d.) Am I making the right improvements to the most impactful aspects of the customer experience (Priority map) and e.) What are customers saying about their experience (Comment Card).  These cards are designed to quickly and easily identify shifts, changes, concerns or successes.
