        <h1>Preferred ForeSee Maintenance Schedule</h1>
        <p>ForeSee maintenance windows are provided to help our clients for planning purposes and is subject to change at ForeSee’s sole discretion.  There may be times when maintenance is scheduled outside of these windows in order to provide the best service to our clients.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in viewing recent updates, please see the <a href="releaseNotes.htm#Release" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%][%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%][%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]">Release Notes</a> section below.</p>
        <p>Scheduled maintenance dates and times are communicated two weeks prior to the date through an in-application pop-up notification when you login to a <span class="wintitle">ForeSee</span> application. Please note: The notification period may be less than two weeks if Emergency System Maintenance is required.</p>
        <p>There are two types of maintenance at <span class="wintitle">ForeSee</span>:  <a href="#System" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]">System Maintenance</a> and <a href="#Release" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]">Release Maintenance</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="System"></a>System Maintenance</h2>
        <p>The purpose of <span class="wintitle">System Maintenance</span> is for sustaining the security, availability, and performance of the technical infrastructure. <span class="wintitle">System Maintenance</span> usually takes place on the second Saturday of each quarter. This avoids disruptions of the system during the regular work week, along with the end-of-month report preparation, which is standard in our industry.</p>
        <h2><a name="Release"></a>Release Maintenance</h2>
        <p>Release Maintenance is for upgrading ForeSee products to deliver enhanced features and functionality. Release Maintenance has three categories: <a href="#Major" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]">Major Releases</a>, <a href="#Patch" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Section%]">Patch Releases</a>, and Emergency Releases.</p>
        <h3><a name="Major"></a>Major Releases</h3>
        <p>New functionality and features for each product are rolled out three times each year:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Winter Release - During the first quarter of the calendar year.</li>
            <li>Spring Release - During the second quarter of the calendar year.</li>
            <li>Fall Release - At the beginning of the fourth quarter of the calendar year to avoid the holidays.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Scheduled maintenance dates and times are communicated two weeks prior through an email notification<MadCap:footnote style="mc-footnote-position: topic;">Email notifications are sent to <span class="wintitle">ForeSee System Administrators </span>(identified as users with <span class="wintitle">Admin</span> permissions) for your organization.</MadCap:footnote> as well as an in-application pop-up notification when you login to a <span class="wintitle">ForeSee</span> application.  The <span class="wintitle">Release Notes</span> document, describing new features and functionality, is also posted in this section of the <span class="wintitle">CX Help &amp; Training Guide</span>.</p>
        <h3><a name="Patch"></a>Patch Releases and Daily Releases</h3>
        <p>These releases are typically used to deliver scheduled and ad-hoc, or as-needed, fixes. <span class="wintitle">Patch</span> and <span class="wintitle">Daily Releases</span> are usually seamless to clients.  Whenever possible, these releases are deployed during off-peak hours and without downtime.  <span class="wintitle">Patch Releases</span> are scheduled weekly and are usually deployed as needed each Thursday.  <span class="wintitle">Daily Releases</span> are conducted on an as-needed basis and can occur any day of the week.</p>
