        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Settings</span> tab offers a  list of open end questions for active and inactive measures. The <span class="wintitle">Processed</span> column shows the number of responses included in the data over the total number of responses. When a question is activated for processing, you can select to have all responses processed, or only those responses submitted after the question is activated. In this scenario, if the percentage is not 100%, there are previous responses to the question which are not included in the <span class="wintitle">Text Analytics</span> data. </p>
