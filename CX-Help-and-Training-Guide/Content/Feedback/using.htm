        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <h3>Top Navigation Bar</h3>
        <p>The top navigation bar, which runs along the top edge of the page, is the primary means of moving from one page to another. The <span class="uicontrol">ForeSee</span> logo is an action feature that you can click on to return to the <span class="wintitle">Projects</span> page. Next to the logo, the main application pages are available for you to navigate directly to at any time. </p>
        <p>Click the <span class="uicontrol">Help</span> icon (?) to display this <span class="wintitle">Help</span> feature in a separate browser window. The last action feature on the toolbar is your user name and a menu of features, such as <span class="wintitle">Client Search</span>, a list of clients, and <span class="uicontrol">Log Out</span>, which is determined by your <span class="wintitle">User Permissions</span>. </p>
        <h3>Projects Page</h3>
        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Projects</span> page displays a list of projects you have access to, which are grouped by application, such as <span class="wintitle">ForeSee Feedback</span> and <span class="wintitle">ForeSee Replay</span>. Each project name can be clicked to edit. There are also icons on the right to navigate to a specific page within the project. A tooltip displays when you mouse over the icon to inform you what the icon is for.</p>
        <h2>Using Help</h2>
        <h3>Labels and Actions</h3>
        <p>As you view <span class="wintitle">ForeSee CX Suite Help</span> you may notice items in <span class="wintitle">bold</span> and <span class="uicontrol">bold-italic</span>. This is to help you identify <span class="wintitle">Labels</span>, such as a text field label, and <span class="uicontrol">Actions</span>, as in a graphical user interface button or link. Other styles include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="option">Menu Options</span>
            </li>
            <li><span class="systemoutput">System Output (or default settings)</span>
            </li>
            <li><code>Programming syntax</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
