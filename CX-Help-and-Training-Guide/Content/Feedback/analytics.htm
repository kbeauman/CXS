        <h3>Filtering Data</h3>
        <p>The pages of the <span class="wintitle">Analytics</span> tab are interactive, which allows you to select specific data to view or omit. The filtering features of the <span class="wintitle">Summary</span> and <span class="wintitle">The Survey</span> pages enable you to limit the data based on a common response. In addition to using the <span class="wintitle">Date</span> picker of the left pane, you may also filter data using the following options:</p>
        <h4>Summary</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>To view a single topic, click a topic name in a graph key. Your selection displays in the left pane as a record of how the data is being filtered. Click the <span class="uicontrol">Close</span> icon (<b>X</b>) to remove the filter and show all data again.</li>
            <li>To view a single day's data, click the bar of the <span class="wintitle">Submissions</span> chart or the line of the <span class="wintitle">Overall Rating</span> chart at the desired date. Use <span class="wintitle">Date</span> to see a range of dates again.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The Survey</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Click an answer option or the corresponding <span class="uicontrol">Filter</span> icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/filterIcon.png" title="Filter Icon" alt="filter icon" />) to build a filter and view specific data. Your selection displays in the left pane as a record of how the data is being filtered. Click the <span class="uicontrol">Close</span> icon (<b>X</b>) to remove the filter and show unfiltered data again.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This section explains the menus of the left pane, which are used to change what data is displayed. When you select a menu item, the page refreshes to display data matching the specifications of the left pane menus.</p>
        <p>The following options are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="wintitle">Date</span> - Data is collected daily upon each day's completion. Therefore, all date ranges are based on the previous day's data and extend historically. To change the date range:<MadCap:snippetBlock src="../Resources/Snippets/DateRangeSelection.flsnp" /></li>
            <li><span class="wintitle">Project</span> - Defaults to the project name which you are editing. Use this menu to display the <span class="wintitle">Overview</span> tab of another project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, the <span class="wintitle">Respondents</span> page allows you to sort responses by date or rating. The default setting is <span class="option">Date - New to Old</span>, which groups all responses of each day starting with the most recent.</p>
