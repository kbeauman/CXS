        <p>The <span class="wintitle">Topics</span> feature allows you to present a dynamic survey focused on areas you feel are important. For example, a <span class="wintitle">Color</span> topic may consist of questions about the appeal and quantity of product colors, along with suggestions for new colors. Another topic may be <span class="wintitle">Technical Issues</span> with a comment box for respondents to inform you of problems they may be experiencing with the web page.</p>
        <p>When a respondent opens the survey, they see two questions. They can enter a star rating and then select a desired topic. The questions you assign to the selected topic then display for the respondent to complete.</p>
        <p>You may also control where each topic displays on the web site by using the <span class="wintitle">White List</span> area of the <span class="wintitle">Configure Survey</span> page. For example, if you have a product line where the <span class="wintitle">Color</span> topic does not apply, clear the <span class="wintitle">Show Site-wide</span> check box and list the URLs of the pages you want the <span class="wintitle">Color</span> topic to display on.</p>
        <p>To set up a topic:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <span class="wintitle">Projects</span> page, click the <span class="uicontrol">Edit</span> icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/Pencil.png" title="Edit icon" alt="edit icon" />) of the desired project. The <span class="wintitle">Create/Edit Survey</span> page displays.
            </li>
            <li>In the left pane under <span class="wintitle">Topic</span>, drag and drop <span class="option">Add a new topic</span> into the <span class="wintitle">Choose a topic</span> section.</li>
            <li>Click on the title bar to enable editing of the topic name.</li>
            <li>Change <span class="systemoutput">New Topic</span> to a desired name for the topic.</li>
            <li>In the left pane under <span class="wintitle">Content Types</span>, drag and drop the desired question type to the new topic.</li>
            <li>Click on the default text <span class="systemoutput">Enter your question...</span> and type in your question.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="uicontrol">Save</span> or click outside the container to store your revisions.</li>
        </ol>
