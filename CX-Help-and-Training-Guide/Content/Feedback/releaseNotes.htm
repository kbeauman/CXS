                <p>We have made updates to the configure flow to make it easier for you to build, choose, configure, and publish your surveys.</p>
                <p>You now have a new step to <span class="wintitle">Choose Survey Type</span>.  This step really breaks out the survey badge and type customization from the configure flow.  The <span class="uicontrol">Manual Launch Survey</span> option (customer defined link) is now also a part of this page.</p>

                <p>The <span class="wintitle">Configure Survey</span> step allows you to use the <span class="wintitle">White List</span> feature as you had in the past and take advantage of a new feature to update the <span class="wintitle">Privacy Policy</span>, which is described below.</p>

                <p>The <span class="wintitle">Product</span> and <span class="wintitle">Engineering</span> teams rolled-out the <span class="wintitle">Spring Follow-up Release</span> with the last few planned enhancements and a handful of issue fixes.</p>
                <p>The <span class="wintitle">Replay for Feedback</span> capability is now available on the production servers. We plan to do a few rounds of internal testing with <span class="wintitle">ForeSee.com</span>, and will then make <span class="wintitle">Replay</span> available to a couple clients that have already purchased <span class="wintitle">Replay</span>, being careful to step them through the integration process.</p>
                <p>In addition to adding <span class="wintitle">Replay</span>, this release of <span class="wintitle">Feedback</span> includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Surveys (within the <span class="wintitle">Feedback</span> product) may now contain hyperlinked text in the question. When editing a survey, you can highlight a character, word, or phrase, and a <span class="wintitle">Link</span> dialog displays to click and the link address to.</li>
                    <li>Users with administrator permissions may delete <span class="wintitle">Feedback</span> survey <span class="wintitle">Replays</span>, as well as the entire respondent record.</li>
                    <li>Custom work for clients was completed.</li>
                    <li>Other minor enhancements and bug fixes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Like with all releases there are a few items that we carry over. Below are a list of known issues we are still working to address in additional:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Replay for <span class="wintitle">Feedback</span> support for <span class="wintitle">Internet Explorer 9</span>.</li>
                    <li><span class="wintitle">Respondent Meta Data</span> includes the <span class="wintitle">Trigger Code URL</span>.</li>

            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>We have launched new alerting capabilities for our real time alerting system for <span class="wintitle">Feedback</span> in the <span class="wintitle">VOC Portal</span>.  These are additional capabilities to the current system where you can set up alerts in the <span class="wintitle">Portal</span> based on the surveys you have created.</p>
                <p><span class="wintitle">Keyword</span> - We have added two ways to alert by <span class="wintitle">Keyword</span>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exact Match (=) is exact match (case/spelling everything exact)
            <div class="example">If your consumer has completed a feedback survey and ANYWHERE in an open-ended response this keyword direct, you receive an alert.</div></li>
                    <li>Contains is a partial (fuzzy match) keywords for English open-ends.
			<div class="example">If the keyword was "ForeSee" then "ForeSee" and "Foreseee" would both match. The search is also case insensitive. If your consumer has completed a <span class="wintitle">ForeSee Feedback</span> survey and ANYWHERE in an open-ended response this keyword, you receive an alert.
			<ul><li><span class="wintitle">Phase 2 (to launch in Feb)</span> of this will be to enhance language detection, remove common words, and expand fuzzy search.
			</li></ul></div></li>
                </ul>
                <p><span class="wintitle">URL Based</span> - We have added two ways to alert by URL:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exact Match (=)</li>
                    <li>Supports white-listing the same as before when you configure your survey. 
			<div class="example">If consumer provides feedback on the exact URL or a white-listed URL designated, that triggers an alert.</div></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This feature makes it easier for you to filter out certain information from your respondent data opening up the ability to drill down to any segment of feedback providers by any keyword in an open-ended comment, attribute data like browser or operating system, etc.</p>
                <p>The <span class="wintitle">Respondent</span> page has been enhanced to include a search field so user can search on things like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Respondent ID (you can grab this from an alert email or report to drill down to see the date in the portal)</li>
                    <li>Survey information (like keywords within comments)</li>
                    <li>Meta data (Browser, OS)</li>
                </ul>
