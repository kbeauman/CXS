            <h1> About Case Management</h1>
        </div>
        <p><span class="wintitle">Case Management</span> can receive feeds directly from a survey or be manually entered to manage the life cycle of a problem resolution or the implementation of improvements. This type of application has several categorizations: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Closed Loop Management</li>
            <li>Find and Fix</li>
            <li>Recovery Management</li>
            <li>Issue Management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A <i>Case</i> is a single repository consisting of the original issue, customer contact information, internal attachments and notes, as well as documentation of what actions are taken in response to the issue. A case is expected to be resolved within a specific time frame (e.g., 72 hours) of its creation. Therefore, <span class="wintitle">Case Management</span> functions on a real-time basis in order to present the most current information.</p>
        <h2>User Roles</h2>
        <p>There are two main user levels for Case Management: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="wintitle">Caseworker</span> - This user level sees only cases assigned to them. Caseworkers can add, work, escalate, and resolve a case within their assigned hierarchy level, i.e., they cannot access a case assigned to another caseworker. See <a href="workCase.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Work on a Case</a> for additional information.</li>
            <li><span class="wintitle">Manager</span> - This user level sees their assigned hierarchy level, such as a district or region. Managers can perform all the same tasks as a caseworker, but have access to all cases under their supervision. See <a href="ManageSection.htm" title="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]" alt="[%=Tooltips.Tooltip Topic%]">Managing Cases</a> for additional information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="Supporte"></a>Supported Measures</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:snippetText src="../Resources/Snippets/AutoCases.flsnp" /> Manual cases are not created from a survey, but must still be associated with a hierarchy supported <span class="wintitle">ForeSee CX Measure</span> in order to be reported in <span class="wintitle">CX Suite</span>.</p>
        <p>Currently, the following <span class="wintitle">CX Measures</span> are capable of integrating with <span class="wintitle">Case Management</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location/Store</li>
            <li>In Store Pick Up/BOPIS</li>
            <li>Contact Center (No IVR)</li>
            <li>Fulfillment</li>
        </ul>
